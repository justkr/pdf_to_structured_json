Insurance Handbook A guide to insurance: what it does and how it works To The Reader F or over 50 years, the Insurance Information Institute (I.I.I.) has provided information to help consumers, reporters, insurance companies and researchers understand how insurance works and what it does. The Insurance Handbook is the latest addition to I.I.I.\u2019s vast arsenal of resources, including books, brochures, newsletters and videos. Long a primary source of information, analysis and referral on property/casualty insurance issues, the I.I.I. has broadened its reach over the years. Today, the I.I.I. is also a leading source for clear, comprehensive information on annuities, retirement and other life/health insurance concerns. The Insurance Handbook reflects this diversity of subjects and issues. The book begins with basic information on the various types of insurance, including auto, home, life, annuities and long-term care. A glossary section contains over 500 entries, including over 100 life insurance definitions provided by LOMA, a worldwide association of life and financial services companies. A directory lists a wide range of insurance organizations, including national, state and specialty associations. Issues briefs provide overviews of the trends and developments shaping the insurance industry from natural catastrophes to terrorism to workplace safety. The Handbook is designed to be used in conjunction with the Institute\u2019s other information resources: our Web site (www.iii.org), which provides comprehensive information on all aspects of insurance, and our various publications, including the Insurance Fact Book, the Financial Services Fact Book and A Firm Foundation: How Insurance Supports the Economy. Its scope and clarity make it an ideal source for a wide variety of audiences, including: Reporters Public policymakers Regulators Students Insurance company employees Academics We believe this Handbook will prove a source of vital information to the media and others who have long relied on the I.I.I.\u2019s spokespersons and resources for creditable, timely information. We appreciate your comments.

Inside back cover I n s u r a n c e B a s i c s Overview The insurance industry safeguards the assets of its policyholders by transferring risk from an individual or business to an insurance company. Insurance compa- nies act as financial intermediaries in that they invest the premiums they collect for providing this service. Insurance company size is usually measured by net premiums written, that is, premium revenues less amounts paid for reinsurance. There are three main insurance sectors: property/casualty, life/health and health insurance. Property/casualty (P/C) consists mainly of auto, home and commer- cial insurance. Life/health (L/H) consists mainly of life insurance and annuity products. Health insurance is offered by private health insurance companies and some L/H and P/C insurers, as well as by government programs such as Medicare.", "OperationalPageNumber": "3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8", "PageNumber": ", 1", "Footer": ", 2010 Insurance Information Institu\u00a7te. 978-0-932387-47-9, I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Regulation", "Text": "All types of insurance are regulated by the states, with each state having its own set of statutes and rules. State insurance departments oversee insurer sol- vency, market conduct and, to a greater or lesser degree, review and rule on requests for rate increases for coverage. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners develops model rules and regulations for the industry, many of which must be approved by state legislatures. The McCarran-Ferguson Act, passed by Congress in 1945, refers to continued state regulation of the insurance industry as being in the public interest. Under the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act, insurance activities\u2014whether conducted by banks, broker-dealers or insurers\u2014are regulated by the states. However, there have been, and continue to be, challenges to state regulation from some seg- ments of the federal government as well as from some financial services firms.", "OperationalPageNumber": 8, "PageNumber": 1, "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Accounting", "Text": "Insurers are required to use statutory accounting principles (SAP) when filing annual financial reports with state regulators and the Internal Revenue Service. SAP, which evolved to enhance the industry\u2019s financial stability, is more conservative than the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), established by the inde- pendent Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires publicly owned companies to report their financial results using GAAP rules. Insurers outside the United States use standards that dif- fer from SAP and GAAP. As global markets developed, the need for more uniform accounting standards became clear. In 2001 the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), an independent international accounting standards setting organiza- tion, began work on a set of standards, called International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that it hopes will be used around the world. Since 2001 over 100 countries have required or permitted the use of IFRS. In 2007 the SEC voted to stop requiring non-U.S. companies that use IFRS to re-issue their financial reports for U.S. investors using GAAP. In 2008 the National Association of Insurance Commissioners began to explore ways to move from statutory accounting principles to IFRS. Also in 2008, the FASB and IASB undertook a joint project to develop a common and improved framework for financial reporting.", "OperationalPageNumber": 9, "PageNumber": 2, "Header": "Insurance Basics Overview", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Distribution", "Text": "Property/casualty and life insurance policies were once sold almost exclusively by agents\u2014either by captive agents, representing one insurance company, or by independent agents, representing several companies.

In addition, in the 1980s banks began to explore the possibility of selling insurance through independent agents, usually buying agencies for that purpose. Other distribu- tion channels include sales through professional organizations and through workplaces.", "OperationalPageNumber": 9, "PageNumber": 2, "Header": "Insurance Basics Overview", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Auto Insurance Basics", "Text": "Auto insurance protects against financial loss in the event of an accident. It is a contract between the policyholder and the insurance company. The policyhold- er agrees to pay the premium and the insurance company agrees to pay losses as defined in the policy. Auto insurance provides property, liability and medical coverage: Property coverage pays for damage to, or theft of, the car. Liability coverage pays for the policyholder\u2019s legal responsibility to others for bodily injury or property damage. Medical coverage pays for the cost of treating injuries, rehabilitation and sometimes lost wages and funeral expenses. Most states require drivers to have auto liability insurance before they can legal- ly drive a car. (Liability insurance pays the other driver\u2019s medical, car repair and other costs when the policyholder is at fault in an auto accident.) All states have laws that set the minimum amounts of insurance or other financial security drivers have to pay for the harm caused by their negligence behind the wheel if an accident occurs. Most auto policies are for six months to a year. A basic auto insurance policy is comprised of six different kinds of coverage, each of which is priced separately (see below). 1. Bodily Injury Liability This coverage applies to injuries that the policyholder and family members list- ed on the policy cause to someone else. These individuals are also covered when driving other peoples\u2019 cars with permission. As motorists in serious accidents may be sued for large amounts, drivers can opt to buy more than the state- required minimum to protect personal assets such as homes and savings. 2. Medical Payments or Personal Injury Protection (PIP) This coverage pays for the treatment of injuries to the driver and passengers of the policyholder\u2019s car. At its broadest, PIP can cover medical payments, lost wages and the cost of replacing services normally performed by someone injured in an auto accident. It may also cover funeral costs. 3. Property Damage Liability This coverage pays for damage policyholders (or someone driving the car with their permission) may cause to someone else\u2019s property. Usually, this means damage to someone else\u2019s car, but it also includes damage to lamp posts, tele- phone poles, fences, buildings or other structures hit in an accident. 4. Collision This coverage pays for damage to the policyholder\u2019s car resulting from a col- lision with another car, an object or as a result of flipping over. It also covers damage caused by potholes. Collision coverage is generally sold with a deduct- ible of $250 to $1,000\u2014the higher the deductible, the lower the premium. Even if policyholders are at fault for an accident, collision coverage will reimburse them for the costs of repairing the car, minus the deductible. If the policyholder is not at fault, the insurance company may try to recover the amount it paid from the other driver\u2019s insurance company, a process known as subrogation. If the company is successful, policyholders will also be reimbursed for the deduct- ible. 5. Comprehensive This coverage reimburses for loss due to theft or damage caused by something other than a collision with another car or object, such as fire, falling objects, missiles, explosions, earthquakes, windstorms, hail, flood, vandalism and riots, or contact with animals such as birds or deer. Comprehensive insurance is usu- ally sold with a $100 to $300 deductible, though policyholders may opt for a higher deductible as a way of lowering their premium. Comprehensive insur- ance may also reimburse the policyholder if a windshield is cracked or shattered. Some companies offer separate glass coverage with or without a deductible. States do not require the purchase of collision or comprehensive coverage, but lenders may insist borrowers carry it until a car loan is paid off. It may also be a requirement of some dealerships if a car is leased. 6. Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage Uninsured motorist coverage will reimburse the policyholder, a member of the family or a designated driver if one of them is hit by an uninsured or a hit-and- run driver. Underinsured motorist coverage comes into play when an at-fault driver has insufficient insurance to pay for the other driver\u2019s total loss. This cov- erage will also protect a policyholder who is hit while a pedestrian.", "OperationalPageNumber": "10, 11", "PageNumber": "3, 4", "Header": "Insurance Basics Auto Insurance", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Homeowners Insurance Basics", "Text": "Homeowners insurance provides financial protection against disasters. It is a pack- age policy, which means that it covers both damage to property and liability, or legal responsibility, for any injuries and property damage policyholders or their families cause to other people. This includes damage caused by household pets. Damage caused by most disasters is covered but there are exceptions. Standard homeowners policies do not cover flooding, earthquakes or poor maintenance. Flood coverage, however, is available in the form of a separate policy both from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and from a few private insur- ers. Earthquake coverage is available either in the form of an endorsement or as a separate policy. Most maintenance-related problems are the homeowners\u2019 responsibility. A standard homeowners insurance policy includes four essential types of coverage. They include: 1. Coverage for the Structure of the Home This part of a policy pays to repair or rebuild a home if it is damaged or destroyed by fire, hurricane, hail, lightning or other disaster listed in the policy. It will not pay for damage caused by a flood, earthquake or routine wear and tear. Most standard policies also cover structures that are not attached to a house such as a garage, tool shed or gazebo. Generally, these structures are cov- ered for about 10 percent of the total amount of insurance on the structure of the home. 2. Coverage for Personal Belongings Furniture, clothes, sports equipment and other personal items are covered if they are stolen or destroyed by fire, hurricane or other insured disaster. Most companies provide coverage for 50 to 70 percent of the amount of insurance on the structure of a home. This part of the policy includes off-premises coverage. This means that belongings are covered anywhere in the world, unless the poli- cyholder has decided against off-premises coverage. Expensive items like jewelry, furs and silverware are covered, but there are usually dollar limits if they are sto- len. To insure these items to their full value, individuals can purchase a special personal property endorsement or floater and insure the item for its appraised value. Trees, plants and shrubs are also covered under standard homeowners insur- ance\u2014generally up to about $500 per item. Perils covered are theft, fire, light- ning, explosion, vandalism, riot and even falling aircraft. They are not covered for damage by wind or disease. 3. Liability Protection Liability coverage protects against the cost of lawsuits for bodily injury or prop- erty damage that policyholders or family members cause to other people. It also pays for damage caused by pets. The liability portion of the policy pays for both the cost of defending the policyholder in court and any court awards\u2014up to the limit of the policy. Coverage is not just in the home but extends to anywhere in the world. Liability limits generally start at about $100,000. However, experts recommend that homeowners purchase at least $300,000 worth of protection. An umbrella or excess liability policy, which provides broader coverage, includ- ing claims for libel and slander, as well as higher liability limits, can be added to the policy. Generally, umbrella policies cost between $200 to $350 for $1 mil- lion of additional liability protection. Homeowners policies also provide no-fault medical coverage. In the event that someone is injured in a policyholder\u2019s home, the injured person can sim- ply submit medical bills to the policyholder\u2019s insurance company. In this way expenses are paid without a liability claim being filed. This coverage, however, does not pay the medical bills for the policyholder\u2019s own family or pets. 4. Additional Living Expenses This pays the additional costs of living away from home if a house is inhabit- able due to damage from a fire, storm or other insured disaster. It covers hotel bills, restaurant meals and other extra living expenses incurred while the home is being rebuilt. Coverage for additional living expenses differs from company to company. Many policies provide coverage for about 20 percent of the insurance on a house. The coverage can be increased for an additional premium. Some companies sell a policy that provides an unlimited amount of loss-of-use cover- age, but for a limited amount of time. Additional living expense coverage also reimburses homeowners who rent out part of their home for the rent that would have been collected from a ten- ant if the home had not been destroyed.", "OperationalPageNumber": "12, 13", "PageNumber": "5, 6", "Header": "Insurance Basics Homeowners Insurance", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Homeowners Insurance Basics -> Types of Homeowners Insurance Policies", "Text": "There are several types of homeowners insurance policies that differ in the amount of insurance coverage they provide. The different types are fairly standard through- out the country. However, individual states and companies may offer policies that are slightly different or go by other names such as \u201cstandard\u201d or \u201cdeluxe.\u201d People who rent the homes they live in have specific renters policies. The various types of homeowners insurance policies are listed below. HO-3: This is the most common policy and protects the home from all perils except those specifically excluded. HO-1: Limited coverage policy This \u201cbare bones\u201d policy provides coverage against the first 10 disasters. It is no longer available in most states. HO-2: Basic policy A basic policy provides protection against all 16 disasters. There is a version of HO-2 designed for mobile homes. HO-8: Older home Designed for older homes, this policy usually reimburses for damage on an actual cash value basis, which means replacement cost less depreciation. Full replacement cost policies may not be available for some older homes. HO4: Renter Created specifically for people who rent the home they live in, this policy protects personal possessions and any parts of the apartment that the policyholder owns, such as newly installed kitchen cabinets, against all 16 disasters. H0-6: Condo/Co-op A policy for people who own a condo or co-op, it provides coverage for belongings and the structural parts of the building that they own. It protects against all 16 disasters.", "OperationalPageNumber": "13, 14", "PageNumber": "6, 7", "Header": "Insurance Basics Homeowners Insurance", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Homeowners Insurance Basics -> What Type of Disasters Are Covered?", "Text": "Most homeowners policies cover the 16 disasters listed below.

Some of these exclusions are discussed below. 1. Floods Flood damage is excluded under standard homeowners and renters insurance poli- cies. Flood coverage, however, is available in the form of a separate policy both from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and from a few private insurers. Additional information on flood insurance can be found on the FloodSmart.gov Web site or by calling 888-379-9531. For coverage over and above the $250,000 limit for property and $100,000 for contents provided by the NFIP, excess flood insurance is available from private insurance companies. (See Topic on Flood Insurance on page 47 for further information.) Tsunamis cause flood damage and are therefore only covered by a flood policy. 2. Earthquakes Earthquake coverage can be a separate policy or an endorsement to a home- owners or renters policy. It is available from most insurance companies. In California, it is also available from the California Earthquake Authority, a pri- vately funded, publically managed organization. In earthquake prone states like California, the policy comes with a high deductible. 3. Damage Resulting from \u201cFaulty, Defective or Inadequate\u201d Maintenance, Workmanship, Construction or Materials Defective products can include construction materials.  An insurance policy will not cover damage due to lack of maintenance, mold, termite infestation and infestation from other pests.

Actual Cash Value This type of coverage pays to replace the home or possessions minus a deduc- tion for depreciation. 2. Replacement Cost This type of coverage pays the cost of rebuilding or repairing the home or replacing possessions without a deduction for depreciation. 3. Guaranteed/Extended Replacement Cost An extended replacement cost policy pays a certain percentage, generally 20-25 percent, over the coverage limit to rebuild the home in the event that materials and labor costs are pushed up by a widespread disaster, for example. For exam- ple, if homeowners take out a policy for $100,000, they can get up to an extra 20,000 or $25,000 of coverage. Some companies offer a guaranteed replacement cost policy, which pays whatever it costs to rebuild the home as it was before the fire or other disaster, even if it exceeds the policy limit. This gives protection against sudden increases in construction costs due to a shortage of building materials after a widespread disaster or other unexpected situations. It generally does not cover the cost of upgrading the house to comply with current building codes. However, an endorsement (or an addition to) the policy called Ordinance or Law can help pay for these additional costs. Guaranteed and extended replacement cost policies are more expensive; but can offer excellent financial protection against disasters. This type of coverage, however, may not be available in all states or from all companies. Business Insurance Basics Most businesses need to purchase at least the following four types of insurance: 1. Property Insurance Property insurance compensates a business if the property used in the business is lost or damaged as the result of various types of common perils, such as fire or theft. Property insurance covers not just a building or structure but also the contents, including office furnishings, inventory, raw materials, machinery, computers and other items vital to a business\u2019s operations. Depending on the type of policy, property insurance may include coverage for equipment break- down, removal of debris after a fire or other destructive event, some types of water damage and other losses.", "OperationalPageNumber": "16, 17", "PageNumber": "9, 10", "Header": "Insurance Basics Homeowners Insurance, Insurance Basics Business Insurance", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Homeowners Insurance Basics -> Business Interruption Insurance", "Text": "Also known as business income insurance, business interruption insurance is a type of property insurance. A business whose property has sustained a direct physical loss such as fire damage or a damaged roof due to a tree falling on it in a windstorm and has to close down completely while the premises are being repaired may lose out to competitors. A quick resumption of business after a disaster is essential. That is why business interruption insurance is so important. There are typically three types of business interruption insurance. A business can purchase any one or combination of these. BusinessIncomeCoverage: Compensates for lost income if a company has to vacate its premises due to disaster-related damage that is covered under the property insurance policy. Business income insurance covers the profits the company would have earned, based on financial records, had the disaster not occurred. The policy also covers operating expenses, such as electricity, that continue even though business activities have come to a temporary halt. ExtraIncomeCoverage: Reimburses the company for a reasonable sum of money that it spends, over and above normal operating expenses, to avoid having to shut down during the restoration period. ContingentBusinessInterruptionInsurance: Protects a businessowner\u2019s earnings following physical loss or damage to the property of the insured\u2019s suppliers or customers, as opposed to its own property. Damage due to floods, earthquakes and acts of terrorism are generally not covered by standard business property insurance but can be purchased through various markets.", "OperationalPageNumber": 17, "PageNumber": 10, "Header": "Insurance Basics Business Insurance", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Homeowners Insurance Basics -> Protection Against Flood Damage", "Text": "Property insurance policies usually exclude coverage for flood damage. Businesses should find out from their local government office or commercial bank whether their business is located in a flood zone and whether their loca- tion has been flooded in the past.

The exception is workers compensation, which covers work- related injuries and deaths including those due to acts of terrorism. 2. Liability Insurance Any enterprise can be sued. Customers may claim that the business caused them harm as the result of, for example, a defective product, an error in a service or disregard for another person\u2019s property. Or a claimant may allege that the busi- ness created a hazardous environment. Liability insurance pays damages for which the business is found liable, up to the policy limits, as well as attorneys\u2019 fees and other legal defense expenses. It also pays the medical bills of any peo- ple injured by, or on the premises of, the business. A Commercial General Liability (CGL) insurance policy is the first line of defense against many common claims. CGL policies cover claims in four basic categories of business liability: Bodily injury Property damage Personal injury (including slander or libel) Advertising injury (damage from slander or false advertising) In addition to covering claims listed above, CGL policies also cover the cost of defending or settling claims. General liability insurance policies always state the maximum amount that the insurer will pay during the policy period. There are two major forms of liability insurance policies a business can select: occurrence and claims made. Both types of policies have their advantages. OccurrencePolicy: An occurrence policy covers a business for harm to others caused by incidents that occurred while a policy is in force, no matter when the claim is filed. For example, a person might sue a business in 2010 for an injury stemming from a fall in 1999. The policy that was in place when the incident occurred (i.e. 1999) will apply, even if the company now has a policy in place with higher limits. Occurrence coverage may not be available in some states or for some industries or professions. ClaimsMadePolicy: A claims made policy covers the business based on the policy that is in force when the claim is made, regardless of when the incident occurred. In the above example, the limits in the policy in effect in 2010 would apply. Businesses with claims made policies can purchase optional \u201ctail coverage.\u201d Tail coverage enables a business to report claims after the policy has ended for alleged injuries that occurred while the policy was in effect. 3. Commercial Vehicle Insurance A commercial auto policy provides coverage for vehicles that are used primar- ily in connection with commercial establishments or business activities. The insurance pays any costs to third parties resulting from bodily injury or property damage for which the business is legally liable up to the policy limits. While the major coverages are the same, commercial auto policies differs from a personal auto policy in a number of technical respects. They may have higher limits and/or provisions that cover rented and other non-owned vehicles, including employees\u2019 cars driven for company business. Several insurers offer business auto policies geared to owners of small businesses or specific types of businesses. 4. Workers Compensation Insurance Employers have a legal responsibility to their employees to make the workplace safe. However, despite precautions, accidents can occur. To protect employers from lawsuits resulting from workplace accidents and to provide medical care and compensation for lost income to employees hurt in workplace accidents, in almost every state businesses are required by law to buy workers compensa- tion insurance. Workers compensation insurance covers workers injured on the job, whether they are hurt on the workplace premises or elsewhere, or in auto accidents while on business. It also covers work-related illnesses. Workers com- pensation provides payments to injured workers, without regard to who was at fault in the accident, for time lost from work and for medical and rehabilitation services. It also provides death benefits to surviving spouses and dependents. Each state has different laws governing the amount and duration of lost income benefits, the provision of medical and rehabilitation services and how the sys- tem is administered. For example, in most states there are regulations that cover whether the worker or employer can choose the doctor who treats the injuries and how disputes about benefits are resolved. Workers compensation insurance must be bought as a separate policy. In-home business and businessowners policies (BOPs) are sold as package poli- cies but do not include coverage for workers\u2019 injuries.", "OperationalPageNumber": "18, 19, 20", "PageNumber": "11, 12, 13", "Header": "Insurance Basics Business Insurance", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Homeowners Insurance Basics -> Other Types of Business Coverages", "Text": "The first four coverages discussed below are different types of liability insurance policies available to businesses. The fifth is a form of life insurance. There are also specialized liability policies geared to specific types of businesses. 1. Errors and Omissions Insurance/Professional Liability Some businesses involve services such as giving advice, making recommenda- tions, designing things, providing physical care or representing the needs of others, which can lead to being sued by customers, clients or patients claiming that the business\u2019 failure to perform a job properly has injured them. Errors and omissions or professional liability insurance covers these situations. The policy will pay any judgment for which the insured is legally liable, up to the policy limit. It also provides legal defense costs, even when there has been no wrong- doing. 2. Employment Practices Liability Insurance Employment practices liability insurance covers, up to the policy limits, dam- ages for which an employer is legally liable such as violating an employee\u2019s civil or other legal rights. In addition to paying a judgment for which the insured is liable, it also provides legal defense costs, which can be substantial even when there has been no wrongdoing. 3. Directors and Officers Liability Insurance Directors and officers liability insurance protects directors and officers of corpo- rations or nonprofit organizations if there is a lawsuit claiming they managed the business or organization without proper regard for the rights of others. The policy will pay any judgment for which the insured is legally liable, up to the policy limit. It also provides for legal defense costs, even where there has been no wrongdoing. 4. Umbrella or Excess Policies As the name implies, an umbrella liability policy provides coverage over and above a business\u2019s other liability coverages. It is designed to protect against unusually high losses, providing protection when the policy limits of one of the underlying policies have been used up. For a typical business, an umbrella poli- cy would provide protection beyond Its general liability and auto liability poli- cies. If a company has employment practices liability insurance, directors and officers liability, or other types of liability insurance, the umbrella could provide protection beyond those policy limits as well. Cost depends on the nature of the business, its size, the type of risks the business faces and the ways the business implements risk reduction. 5. Key Person Life Insurance The loss of a key person can be a major blow to a small business if that person is the founder of the business or is the key contact for customers and suppliers and the management of the business. Loss of the key person may also make the running of the business less efficient and result in a loss of capital. Losses caused by the death of a key employee are insurable. Such policies compensate the business against significant losses that result from that person\u2019s death or disabil- ity. The amount and cost of insurance needed for a particular business depends on the situation and the age, health and role of the key employee. Key employ- ee life insurance pays a death benefit to the company when the key employee dies. The policy is normally owned by the company, which pays the premiums and is the beneficiary. The monies from key person insurance can be used to buy back shares in a company from the estate of the deceased, pay a head hunt- ing firm to find a suitable replacement and cover costs or expenses while the business adjusts to the loss.", "OperationalPageNumber": "20, 21", "PageNumber": "13, 14", "Header": "Insurance Basics Business Insurance", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Homeowners Insurance Basics -> Package Policies", "Text": "Commercial insurers sell coverages separately and/or offer policies that combine protection from most major property and liability risks in one package. Package policies are created for types of businesses that generally face the same kind and degree of risk. 1. Packages for Small Businesses Smaller companies often purchase a package policy known as the Business- owners Policy, or BOP. A BOP is recommended for most small businesses (usual- ly 100 employees or less), as it is often the most affordable way to obtain broad coverage. BOPs are \u201coff the shelf\u201d policies combining many of the basic coverag- es needed by a typical small business into a standard package at a premium that is generally less than would be required to purchase these coverages separately. Combining both property and liability insurance, a BOP will cover a business in the event of property damage, suspended operations, lawsuits resulting from bodily injury or property damage to others, etc. BOPs do not cover professional liability, auto insurance, workers compensation or health and disability insur- ance. Small businesses will need separate insurance policies to cover professional services, vehicles and employees. 2. Commercial Multiple Peril Policies Larger companies might purchase a commercial package policy or customize their policies to meet the special risks they face. Commercial multiple peril poli- cies, often purchased by corporations, bundle property, boiler and machinery, crime and general liability coverage together. Larger firms employee a risk man- ager to help determine the company\u2019s exposure to certain risks. 3. In-Home Business Policies There are several insurance options designed to address the special needs of home businesses. HomeownersPolicyEndorsement: Homeowners may be able to add a simple endorsement or rider to their existing homeowners policy to increase coverage. In-HomeBusinessPolicy: An in-home business policy provides more comprehensive coverage for business equipment and liability than a homeowners policy endorsement. Many insurance companies offer insurance policies specifically tailored to small business. BusinessownersPolicy(BOP): The home business might be eligible for The Businessowners Policy (BOP), see above. The key to whether a business owner is eligible for a BOP is the size of the premises, the limits of liability required, the type of commercial operation it is and the extent of its off-premises servicing and processing activities. A BOP, like an in-home business policy, covers business property and equipment, loss of income, extra expense and liability; however, the BOP provides these coverages on a much broader scale.", "OperationalPageNumber": "21, 22", "PageNumber": "14, 15", "Header": "Insurance Basics Business Insurance", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Life Insurance Basics", "Text": "Many financial experts consider life insurance to be the cornerstone of sound financial planning. It can be an important tool in the following situations: 1. Replace Income for Dependents If people depend on an individual\u2019s income, life insurance can replace that income if the person dies. The most common example of this is parents with young children. Insurance to replace income can be especially useful if the government- or employer-sponsored benefits of the surviving spouse or domestic partner will be reduced after he or she dies. 2. Pay Final Expenses Life insurance can pay funeral and burial costs, probate and other estate admin- istration costs, debts and medical expenses not covered by health insurance. 3. Create an Inheritance for Heirs Even those with no other assets to pass on, can create an inheritance by buying a life insurance policy and naming their heirs as beneficiaries. 4. Pay Federal \u201cDeath\u201d Taxes and State \u201cDeath\u201d Taxes Life insurance benefits can pay for estate taxes so that heirs will not have to liq- uidate other assets or take a smaller inheritance. Changes in the federal \u201cdeath\u201d tax rules through January 1, 2011 will likely lessen the impact of this tax on some people, but some states are offsetting those federal decreases with increas- es in their state-level estate taxes. 5. Make Significant Charitable Contributions By making a charity the beneficiary of their life insurance policies, individuals can make a much larger contribution than if they donated the cash equivalent of the policy\u2019s premiums. 6. Create a Source of Savings Some types of life insurance create a cash value that, if not paid out as a death benefit, can be borrowed or withdrawn on the owner\u2019s request. Since most people make paying their life insurance policy premiums a high priority, buying a cash-value type policy can create a kind of \u201cforced\u201d savings plan. Furthermore, the interest credited is tax deferred (and tax exempt if the money is paid as a death claim).", "OperationalPageNumber": 23, "PageNumber": 16, "Header": "Insurance Basics Life Insurance", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Life Insurance Basics -> Types of Life Insurance", "Text": "There are two major types of life insurance: term and whole life. 1. Term Life Term insurance is the simplest form of life insurance. It pays only if death occurs during the term of the policy, which is usually from one to 30 years. Most term policies have no other benefit provisions. There are two basic types of term life insurance policies: level term and decreasing term. Level term means that the death benefit stays the same throughout the duration of the policy. Decreasing term means that the death benefit drops, usually in one-year incre- ments, over the course of the policy\u2019s term. 2. Whole Life/Permanent Life Whole life or permanent insurance pays a death benefit whenever the policy- holder dies. There are three major types of whole life or permanent life insur- ance\u2014traditional whole life, universal life, and variable universal life, and there are variations within each type. In the case of traditional whole life, both the death benefit and the premi- um are designed to stay the same (level) throughout the life of the policy. The cost per $1,000 of benefit increases as the insured person ages, and it obviously gets very high when the insured lives to 80 and beyond. The insurance com- pany keeps the premium level by charging a premium that, in the early years, is higher than what is needed to pay claims, investing that money, and then using it to supplement the level premium to help pay the cost of life insurance for older people. By law, when these \u201coverpayments\u201d reach a certain amount, they must be available to the policyholder as a cash value if he or she decides not to continue with the original plan. The cash value is an alternative, not an additional, ben- efit under the policy. In the 1970s and 1980s, life insurance companies intro- duced two variations on the traditional whole life product: universal life insur- ance and variable universal life insurance. Some varieties of whole life/permanent life insurance are discussed below. UniversalLife: Universal life, also known as adjustable life, allows more flexibility than traditional whole life policies. The savings vehicle (called a cash value account) generally earns a money market rate of interest. After money has accumulated in the account, the policyholder will also have the option of altering premium payments\u2014providing there is enough money in the account to cover the costs. VariableLife: Variable life policies combine death protection with a savings account that can be invested in stocks, bonds and money market mutual funds. The value of the policy may grow more quickly, but involves more risk. If investments do not perform well, the cash value and death benefit may decrease. Some policies, however, guarantee that the death benefit will not fall below a minimum level. VariableUniversalLife: This type of policy combines the features of variable and universal life policies, including the investment risks and rewards characteristic of variable life insurance and the ability to adjust premiums and the death benefit that is characteristic of universal life insurance.", "OperationalPageNumber": "24, 25", "PageNumber": "17, 18", "Header": "Insurance Basics Life Insurance", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Annuities Basics", "Text": "Annuities are financial products intended to enhance retirement security. An annuity is an agreement for one person or organization to pay another a series of payments. Usually the term \u201cannuity\u201d relates to a contract between an indi- vidual and a life insurance company. There are many categories of annuities. They can be classified by: Natureoftheunderlyinginvestment: fixed or variable Primarypurpose: accumulation or pay-out (deferred or immediate) Natureofpayoutcommitment: fixed period, fixed amount or lifetime Taxstatus: qualified or nonqualified Premiumpaymentarrangement: single premium or flexible premium An annuity can be classified in several of these categories at once. For example, an individual might buy a nonqualified single premium deferred variable annuity. In general, annuities have the following features: 1. Tax Deferral on Investment Earnings Many investments are taxed year by year, but the investment earnings\u2014capital gains and investment income\u2014in annuities are not taxable until the investor withdraws money. This tax deferral is also true of 401(k)s and IRAs; however, unlike these products, there are no limits on the amount one can put into an annuity. Moreover, the minimum withdrawal requirements for annuities are much more liberal than they are for 401(k)s and IRAs. 2. Protection from Creditors People who own an immediate annuity (that is, who are receiving money from an insurance company), are afforded some protection from creditors. Generally the most that creditors can access is the payments as they are made, since the money the annuity owner gave the insurance company now belongs to the company. Some state statutes and court decisions also protect some or all of the payments from those annuities. 3. A Variety of Investment Options Many annuity companies offer an array of investment options. For example, individuals can invest in a fixed annuity that credits a specified interest rate, similar to a bank Certificate of Deposit (CD). If they buy a variable annuity, their money can be invested in stocks, bonds or mutual funds. In recent years, annuity companies have created various types of \u201cfloors\u201d that limit the extent of investment decline from an increasing reference point. 4. Taxfree Transfers Among Investment Options In contrast to mutual funds and other investments made with aftertax money, with annuities there are no tax consequences if owners change how their funds are invested. This can be particularly valuable if they are using a strategy called rebalancing,\u201d which is recommended by many financial advisors. Under rebal- ancing, investors shift their investments periodically to return them to the proportions that represent the risk/return combination most appropriate for the investor\u2019s situation. 5. Lifetime Income A lifetime immediate annuity converts an investment into a stream of pay- ments that last until the annuity owner dies. In concept, the payments come from three \u201cpockets\u201d: The original investment, investment earnings and money from a pool of people in the investors group who do not live as long as actuarial tables forecast. The pooling is unique to annuities, and it is what enables annu- ity companies to be able to guarantee a lifetime income. 6. Benefits to Heirs There is a common apprehension that if an individual starts an immediate lifetime annuity and dies soon after that, the insurance company keeps all of the investment in the annuity. To prevent this situation individuals can buy a guaranteed period\u201d with the immediate annuity. A guaranteed period commits the insurance company to continue payments after the owner dies to one or more designated beneficiaries; the payments continue to the end of the stated guaranteed period\u2014usually 10 or 20 years (measured from when the owner started receiving the annuity payments). Moreover, annuity benefits that pass to beneficiaries do not go through probate and are not governed by the annuity owner\u2019s will.", "OperationalPageNumber": "26, 27", "PageNumber": "19, 20", "Header": "Insurance Basics Annuities", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Annuities Basics -> Types of Annuities", "Text": "There are two major types of annuities: fixed and variable. Fixed annuities guar- antee the principal and a minimum rate of interest. Generally, interest credited and payments made from a fixed annuity are based on rates declared by the company, which can change only yearly. Fixed annuities are considered \u201cgeneral account\u201d assets. In contrast, variable annuity account values and payments are based on the performance of a separate investment portfolio, thus their value may fluctuate daily. Variable annuities are considered \u201cseparate account\u201d assets. There are a variety of fixed annuities and variable annuities. One example, the equity indexed annuity, is a hybrid of the features of fixed and variable annuities. It credits a minimum rate of interest, just as other fixed annuities do, but its value is also based on the performance of a specified stock index\u2014usu- ally computed as a fraction of that index\u2019s total return. In December 2008 the Securities and Exchange Commission voted to reclassify indexed annuities (with some exceptions) as securities, not insurance products. Annuities can also be classified by marketing channel, in other words whether they are sold to groups or individuals. Annuities can be deferred or immediate. Deferred annuities generally accu- mulate assets over a long period of time, with withdrawals usually as a single sum or as an income payment beginning at retirement.

Cognitive Impairment Most policies cover stroke and Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease, but other forms of mental incapacity may be excluded. 3. Medical Necessity or Certification by a Doctor that Long-Term Care is Necessary Most policies have a \u201cwaiting period\u201d or \u201celimination\u201d period. This is a period that begins when an individual first needs long-term care and lasts as long as the policy provides. During the waiting period, the policy will not pay benefits. The policy pays only for expenses that occur after the waiting period is over, if the policyholder continues to need care. In general, the longer the waiting period, the lower the premium for the long-term care policy. Benefit periods for long-term care may range from two years to a lifetime. Premiums can be kept down by electing coverage for three to four years\u2014longer than the average nursing home stay\u2014instead of a lifetime. Most long-term care policies pay on a reimbursement (or expense-incurred) basis, up to the policy limits. In other words, if the policy has a $150 per day benefit, but the policyholder spends only $130 per day for a home long-term care provider, the policy will pay only $130. The \u201cextra\u201d $20 each day will, in some policies, go into a \u201cpool\u201d of unused funds that can be used to extend the length of time for which the policy will pay benefits. Other policies pay on an indemnity basis. Using the same example as above, an indemnity policy would pay $150 per day as long as the insured needs and receives long-term care ser- vices, regardless of the actual outlay. Inflation protection is an important feature, especially for people under the age of 65, who are buying benefits that they may not use for 20 years or more. A good inflation provision compounds benefits at 5 percent a year. Without inflation protection, even 3 percent annual inflation will, over 24 years, reduce the purchasing power of a $150 daily benefit to the equivalent of $75.", "OperationalPageNumber": "29, 30", "PageNumber": "22, 23", "Header": "Insurance Basics Long-Term Care Insurance", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Long-Term Care Insurance Basics -> Six Other Important Policy Provisions", "Text": "1.

Guaranteed Renewable Policies These must be renewed by the insurance company, although premiums can go up if they are increased for an entire class of policyholders. 3. Waiver of Premium This provision ensures that no further premiums are due once the policyholder starts to receive benefits. 4. Third-Party Notification This provision stipulates that a relative, friend or professional adviser will be notified if the policyholder forgets to pay a premium. 5. Nonforfeiture Benefits These benefits keep a lesser amount of insurance in force if the policyholder lets the coverage lapse. This provision is required by some states. 6.

Disability insurance, which complements health insurance, helps replace lost income if an individual is unable to work due to a disability. There are three basic ways to replace income. 1. Employer-Paid Disability Insurance This is required in most states. Most employers provide some short-term sick leave. Many larger employers provide long-term disability coverage as well, typi- cally with benefits of up to 60 percent of salary lasting for a period of up to five years until the age of 65, and in some cases extended for life. 2. Social Security Disability Benefits This is paid to workers whose disability is expected to last at least 12 months and is so severe that no gainful employment can be expected. 3. Individual Disability Income Insurance Policies Other limited replacement income is available for workers under some circum- stances from workers compensation (if the injury or illness is job-related), auto insurance (if disability results from an auto accident) and the Department of Veterans Affairs. For most workers, even those with some employer-paid cover- age, an individual disability income policy is the best way to ensure adequate income in the event of disability. Workers who buy a private disability income policy can expect to replace from 50 percent to 70 percent of income. Disability benefits paid out on individual disability policies are not taxed; benefits from employer-paid policies are subject to income tax.", "OperationalPageNumber": 31, "PageNumber": 24, "Header": "Insurance Basics Disability Insurance", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Disability Insurance Basics -> Types of Disability Insurance", "Text": "There are two types of disability policies: Short-term disability and Long-term disability. Short-term policies have a waiting period of 0 to 14 days with a maximum benefit period of no longer than two years. Long-term policies have a waiting period of several weeks to several months with a maximum benefit period ranging from a few years to a lifetime. Disability policies have two different protection features: noncancelable and guaranteed renewable. Noncancelable means that the policy cannot be canceled by the insurance company, except for nonpayment of premiums. This gives the policyholder the right to renew the policy every year without an increase in the premium or a reduction in benefits. Guaranteed renewable gives the policyhold- er the right to renew the policy with the same benefits and not have the policy canceled by the company. However, the insurer has the right to increase premi- ums as long as it does so for all other policyholders in the same rating class. There are several options and factors to consider when purchasing a disabil- ity policy. 1. Additional Purchase Options The insurance company gives the policyholder the right to buy additional insur- ance at a later time. 2. Coordination of Benefits The amount of benefits policyholders receive from their insurance companies is dependent on other benefits they receive because of the disability. The policy specifies a target amount the policyholder will receive from all the policies com- bined and will make up the difference not paid by other policies. 3. Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) The COLA increases disability benefits over time based on the increased cost of living measured by the Consumer Price Index. Policyholders will pay a higher premium if they select the COLA. 4. Residual or Partial Disability Rider This provision allows workers to return to work part-time, collecting part of their salaries and receiving a partial disability payment if they are still partially disabled. 5. Return of Premium This provision requires the insurance company to refund part of the premium if no claims are made for a specific period of time declared in the policy. 6. Waiver of Premium Provision This clause means that the policyholder does not have to pay premiums on the policy after he or she is disabled for 90 days.", "OperationalPageNumber": "31, 32", "PageNumber": "24, 25", "Header": "Insurance Basics Disability Insurance", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Disability Insurance Basics -> Factors Affecting the Choice of a Disability Policy", "Text": "1. Definition of Disability Some policies pay benefits if workers are unable to perform the customary duties of their own occupation. Others pay only if workers are unable to perform any job suitable for their level of education and experience. Some policies define disability in terms of workers\u2019 occupations for an initial period of two or three years and then continue to pay benefits only if they are unable to perform any occupation. \u201cOwn occupation\u201d policies are more desirable, but more expensive. 2. Benefit Period The benefit period is the amount of time policyholders will receive monthly benefits during their lifetimes. Experts usually recommend that the policy pay benefits until at least age 65, at which point Social Security disability will take over. Young people may consider buying a policy offering lifetime benefits because it will still be relatively inexpensive. 3. Replacement Percentage A policy that will replace from 60 percent to 70 percent of total taxable earnings is advisable. A higher replacement percentage, if available, is more expensive. Other sources of income should be evaluated before deciding how much disabil- ity coverage is needed. 4. Coverage for Disability Resulting from Either Accidental Injury or Illness An accident-only policy is less expensive but does not provide adequate protec- tion. Ideally, both accident and illness coverage should be purchased. 5. A Cost-of-Living Increase in Benefits Policies may not pay benefits for a decade or more and should keep pace with increases in the cost of living. (Some companies also offer \u201cindexed\u201d benefits, keeping pace with inflation after benefit payments begin.) 6. A Policy Paying \u201cResidual\u201d or Partial Benefits This type of policy is available so that people can work part-time and still receive a benefit making up for lost income. A standard feature in some policies, and added by a rider to others, a residual benefits policy pays partial benefits based on loss of income without an initial period of total disability. 7. Transition Benefits Offered by some companies, it can offset financial loss during a post-disability period of rebuilding a business or professional practice. 8. Ongoing Coverage A noncancelable policy will continue in-force as long as the premiums are paid; neither the benefit nor the premium can change. A guaranteed renewable policy keeps the same benefits but may cost more over time since the insurer can increase the premium if it is increased for an entire class of policyholders. 9.

Fronting typically means that underwriting, claims and administrative functions are handled in the United States by an experienced commercial insurance company, since a captive generally will not want to get involved directly in running the insurance operation. Also, fronting allows a company to show it has an insur- ance policy with a U.S.-licensed insurance company, which it may need to do for legal and business reasons. The rent-a-captive concept was introduced in Bermuda 20 years ago and remains a popular alternative market mechanism. Rent-a-captives serve busi- nesses that are unable to capitalize a captive but are willing to assume a portion of their own risk and share in the underwriting profits and investment income. Generally sponsored by insurers or reinsurers, which essentially \u201crent out\u201d their capital for a fee, the mechanism allows users to obtain some of the advantages of a captive without having the expense of setting up a single parent captive and meeting minimum capital and surplus requirements. Captives have been expanding into the employee benefits arena since 2003, the year in which the Department of Labor gave final approval to Archer Daniels Midland Co.\u2019s plan to use its Vermont captive to reinsure group life insurance benefits. While the leading domicile for captives in the U.S. is Vermont, offshore captives covering U.S. risks are predominantly located in Bermuda, where they enjoy tax advantages and relative freedom from regulation. The Cayman Islands, Guernsey, the British Virgin Islands, Luxembourg and Barbados are also significant centers for captives. Vermont is the leading domicile for captives in the United States. II. Self Insurance Self insurance can be undertaken by single companies wishing to retain risk or by entities in similar industries or geographic locations that pool resources to insure each other\u2019s risks. The use of higher retentions/deductibles is increasing in most lines of insur- ance. In workers compensation many companies are opting to retain a larger portion of their exposure through policies with large deductible amounts of 100,000 or higher. Large deductible programs, which were first introduced in 1989, now account for a sizable portion of the market. III. Risk Retention Groups A risk retention group (RRG) is a corporation owned and operated by its mem- bers. It must be chartered and licensed as a liability insurance company under the laws of at least one state. The group can then write insurance in all other states. It need not obtain a license in a state other than its chartering states. IV. Risk Purchasing Groups Like risk retention groups (RRGs), purchasing groups must be made up of per- sons or entities with like exposures and in a common business. However, where- as RRGs are liability insurance companies owned by their members, purchasing groups purchase liability coverage for their members from admitted insurers, surplus lines carriers or RRGs. Laws in some states prohibit insurers from giv- ing groups formed to purchase insurance advantages over individuals. However, purchasing groups are not subject to so-called \u201cfictitious group\u201d laws, which require a group to have been in existence for a certain period of time or require a group to have a certain minimum number of members. The Risk Retention Act of 1986 specifically provided for purchasing groups to be created to pur- chase liability insurance for members of the sponsoring groups. V. Catastrophe Bonds and other Alternative Risk Transfer (ART) Products A number of alternative risk transfer (ART) products, such as insurance-linked securities and weather derivatives have developed to meet the financial risk transfer needs of businesses. One such product, catastrophe (cat) bonds, risk- based securities sold via the capital markets, developed in the wake of hurri- canes Andrew and Iniki in 1992 and the Northridge earthquake in 1994\u2014mega- catastrophes that resulted in a global shortage of reinsurance (insurance for insurers) for such disasters. Tapping into the capital markets allowed insurers to diversify their risk and expand the amount of insurance available in catas- trophe-prone areas. Zurich Financial\u2019s Kamp Re was the first major catastrophe bond to be triggered. The $190 million bond was triggered by 2005\u2019s Hurricane Katrina, and resulted in a total loss of principal. Catastrophe bonds are now a multibillion dollar industry.", "OperationalPageNumber": "36, 37, 38", "PageNumber": "29, 30, 31", "Header": "Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Insurance Topics Captives and Other Risk-Financing Options, Insurance Topics Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Captives and Other Risk-Financing Options, Insurance Topics Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Insurance Topics Captives and Other Risk-Financing Options", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Catastrophes: Insurance Issues", "Text": "The term \u201ccatastrophe\u201d in the property insurance industry denotes a natural or man-made disaster that is unusually severe. An event is designated a catastrophe by the industry when claims are expected to reach a certain dollar threshold, currently set at $25 million, and more than a certain number of policyholders and insurance companies are affected. The magnitude of the damage caused by Katrina and the potential dam- age Hurricane Rita might have caused had it not weakened from an intense Category 5 hurricane has triggered a reexamination, not just among insurers and reinsurers but also among public policy and political leaders, of how the United States deals with the financial consequences of such massive property damage and personal loss. Disaster losses along the coast are likely to escalate in the coming years, in part because of huge increases in development. One catastrophe modeling company predicts that catastrophe losses will double every decade or so due to growing residential and commercial density and more expensive buildings. Data from the Census Bureau, collected by USA Today, show that in 2006, 34.9 million people were seriously threatened by Atlantic hurricanes, compared with 10.2 million in 1950. Before the 2005 hurricane season, Hurricane Andrew ranked as the single most costly U.S. natural disaster. Man-made catastrophes such as the attacks on the World Trade Center can also cause huge losses. The attacks led Congress to pass the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) in November 2002. Since then, TRIA has been reauthorized twice. The latest reauthorization, passed at the end of 2007, extends the law to 2014. TRIA provides a federal backstop for commercial insurance losses from terrorist acts, making it easier for insurers to calculate their maximum losses for such a catastrophe and thus to underwrite the coverage, see the topic on Terrorism Risk and Insurance. The typical homeowners insurance policy covers damage from a fire, windstorms, hail, riots and explosions\u2014as well as other types of loss such as theft and the cost of living elsewhere while the structure is being repaired or rebuilt after being damaged. Commercial property insurance policies generally cover the same causes of loss with some variation, depending on the coverages selected. Flood and earthquake damage are excluded under homeowners poli- cies\u2014separate policies are available\u2014but are covered under the comprehensive portion of the standard auto policy, which more than 75 percent of drivers who buy auto liability insurance purchase. The insurance industry tracks catastrophes to monitor claim costs, assign- ing a number to each catastrophe. Each claim arising from the event is tagged so that total industrywide losses can be tabulated. The term catastrophe is often used in the property insurance industry in a narrow way to mean a catastrophic event that exceeds a dollar threshold in claims payouts. This figure has changed over the years with inflation and the increase in development of areas subject to natural disasters. Starting in 1997 the catastrophe definition was raised from $5 million to $25 million in insured damage. There have been four catastrophes that fall into the megacatastrophe catego- ry, greatly exceeding the $25 million threshold. The first two, Hurricane Andrew 1992) and the Northridge earthquake (1994), were both watershed events in that they were far more destructive than most experts had predicted a disaster of this type would be. The third, the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in 2001, altered insurers\u2019 attitudes about man-made risks worldwide. Hurricane Katrina (2005), the fourth catastrophe, is not only the most expensive natural disaster on record but also an event that intensified discussion nationwide about the way disasters, natural and man-made, are managed. It also focused attention on the federal flood insurance program, see the topic on Flood Insurance.", "OperationalPageNumber": "39, 40", "PageNumber": "32, 33", "Header": "Insurance Topics Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Catastrophes: Insurance Issues, Insurance Topics Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Insurance Topics Catastrophes: Insurance Issues", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Cellphones and Driving", "Text": "Increased reliance on cellphones has led to a rise in the number of people who use the devices while driving.

Since the first law was passed in New York in 2001 banning hand-held cellphone use while driving, there has been debate as to the exact nature and degree of hazard.

Still others have focused on the seri- ousness of injuries in crashes involving cellphone users and the demographics of drivers who use cellphones. Of increasing concern is the practice of texting. In January 2010 the National Safety Council (NSC) released a report that estimates that at least 1.6 million crashes (28 percent of all crashes) are caused each year by drivers talking on cellphones (1.4 million crashes) and texting 200,000 crashes). The estimate is based on data of driver cellphone use from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and from peer-reviewed research that quantifies the risks using cellphones and texting while driving. In July 2009 Virginia Tech Transportation Institute released a study show- ing that the risk of texting while driving is far greater than previous estimates showed and far exceeds the hazards associated with other driving distractions. Researchers used cameras in the cabs of trucks traveling long distances over a period of 18 months and found that the collision risk became 23 times higher when the drivers were texting. The research also measured the time drivers stopped looking at the road and used their eyes to send or receive texts. Drivers generally spent nearly five seconds looking at their devices before a crash or near crash, a period long enough for a vehicle to travel more than 100 yards at typical highway speeds.", "OperationalPageNumber": 41, "PageNumber": 34, "Header": "Insurance Topics Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Cellphones and Driving", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Climate Change: Insurance Issues", "Text": "There is now a consensus among the scientific community that the climate is changing, with potential risk to the global economy, ecology, and human health and well being.

As assumers of risk, insurers seek to mitigate potential losses every day through a process known as risk management. Since climate change could lead to losses on a scale never before experienced, insurers are not waiting for researchers to produce all the answers. A 2009 report by Ceres, a network of companies concerned about global warming, identified some 244 insurance- related organizations in 29 countries that were working in 2008 to find solu- tions to the threat posed by greenhouse gas emissions, up from 190 groups in 26 countries in 2007.

Global warming has the potential to affect most segments of the insurance business, including life insurance if rising temperatures lead to an up-tick in death rates.

Some, particularly reinsurers, are sponsoring research and working with others interested in the same kind of solutions, such as find- ing ways for individuals and society to adapt to extreme weather, particularly in developing countries. Many insurance companies are committed to reducing their own total greenhouse gas emissions and offsetting the remainder through contributions to reforestation and renewable energy projects.

Opportunities exist on several fronts. First, there are new risks to insure, including new industries such as wind farms and other alternative fuel facilities, and emerging financial risks such as those involved in carbon trading. Insurance policies related to carbon trading protect those that invest in clean technol- ogy projects against failure of the project to deliver the agreed-upon emission rights. A number of companies are also offering their clients carbon project risk management consulting services. A carbon credit permits the holder to emit one ton of carbon. The Kyoto Protocol and other cap and trade systems now under discussion set ceilings for carbon output and allow those that produce less than the limit to sell credits to those that exceed it. Investors in clean technology projects such as reforestation and renewable energy buy the rights to credits and sell them in the international carbon trading market. Among the risks associated with purchasing carbon trading rights is that the technology/project designed to reduce carbon emissions will not meet expectations or that the company will become insolvent before it is able to fulfill its contract, leaving the investor without the necessary carbon offsets. Second, the need to curb global warming has spurred the creation of insur- ance policies that provide incentives to policyholders to contribute to these efforts.

There are two ways to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with driving. One is to encourage people to purchase vehicles that emit less carbon dioxide into the environment and get more miles per gallon of gasoline. A number of companies offer discounts to people who drive hybrid vehicles\u2014 some believe that people who are socially responsible are also more responsible behind the wheel. The other way is to reward people for driving fewer miles, known as pay-as-you-drive (PAYD) auto insurance. Several insurers have devel- oped technology-based discount programs that provide financial incentives to drive fewer miles. Mileage information comes from a special device. In some, it is linked to the car\u2019s odometer and in others it is a wireless sensor that can monitor speed as well as mileage. These programs are offered in a growing num- ber of states.

Policies generally cover the cost of getting back online, such as utility charges for inspection and reconnection. Some insurers offer homeowners insurance policies that, in the event of a fire or other disaster, allow policyholders to rebuild to environmentally respon- sible \u201cgreen\u201d standards, even if they had not purchased such a policy originally.

In a similar study, the FTC found that auto insurers\u2019 use of insurance credit scores leads to more accurate underwriting of auto insurance policies in that there is a correlation between insurance scores and the likelihood of filing an insurance claim. The FTC report, Credit-Based Insurance Scores: Impacts on Consumers of Automobile Insurance, released in July 2007, also states that credit scores cannot easily be used as a proxy for race and ethnic origin. In other words, credit scoring predicted risk for members of minority groups in much the same way that it predicted risk for members of nonminority groups. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act of 2003 directed the FTC to address the issue of whether the use of credit had a disparate impact on the availability and affordability of insurance for minorities.

The Federal Reserve also studied the use of credit scoring. Although looking at credit scoring to quantify risk posed by a borrower rather than an applicant for insurance or a policyholder, the Federal Reserve said in a report issued at the end of August 2007 that credit scores were predictive of credit risk and were not proxies or substitutes for race ethnicity or gender, underscoring the FTC study.", "OperationalPageNumber": "46, 47", "PageNumber": "39, 40", "Header": "Insurance Topics Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Insurance Topics Credit Scoring Auto Insurance, Insurance Topics Credit Scoring Auto Insurance Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Credit Scoring -> Insurance Scores:", "Text": "Insurance scores are confidential rankings based on credit history information.

One of the worst catastrophes in U.S. history, the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906, would have caused insured losses of $96 billion, were the quake to hit under current eco- nomic and demographic conditions, according to AIR Worldwide. The potential cost of earthquakes has been growing because of increasing urban development in seismically active areas and the vulnerability of older buildings, which may not have been built or upgraded to current building codes. The Northridge earthquake, which struck Southern California on January 17, 1994, was the most costly quake in U.S. history, causing an estimated $20 billion in total property damage, including $12.5 billion in insured losses. In its wake the California Earthquake Authority (CEA) was created in 1996. Fearing insolvency from another massive earthquake, the vast majority of insurers in the state\u2019s homeowners insurance market had severely restricted or ceased writ- ing coverage altogether after Northridge. To ensure the availability of homeown- ers coverage and end a serious threat to the vitality of the state\u2019s housing mar- ket, the California Legislature established the CEA as a publicly managed, largely privately funded entity. Only about 12 percent of Californians now purchase earthquake coverage, down from about 30 percent in 1996 when the devastating 1994 Northridge quake was still fresh in people\u2019s minds. To encourage more Californians to buy the coverage, the CEA, approved an average 22 percent rate cut, which went into effect July 1, 2006. The CEA says that a sharp drop in the cost of reinsur- ance and several years without a major quake, allowing the buildup reserves, made the cut possible.", "OperationalPageNumber": 50, "PageNumber": 43, "Header": "Insurance Topics Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Insurance Topics Earthquakes: Risk and Insurance Issues Auto Insurance", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Earthquakes: Risk and Insurance Issues -> Losses from Major Recent Earthquakes:", "Text": "At the beginning of 2010 there were two major earthquakes: a 7.0 magnitude quake in Haiti in January and a 8.8 magnitude quake in Chile in February.

Some are external, such as the state of the economy, changes in interest rates and the stock market, regulatory activity, the number and severity of natural disasters, growth in litigation and rising medical costs. Others are internal, such as the level of competition. Fortunately, insurance companies run their businesses conservatively, as if every day might bring some new disaster, so despite current economic and financial conditions, the industry has been able to function normally. Unlike banks, insurers are not highly leveraged (they generally do not borrow to make investments or to pay claims); they limit the amount of risk they assume to the capital they have on hand; and because they do not sell the risks they assume to another party\u2014they have some \u201cskin in the game\u201d\u2014they must underwrite care- fully or suffer the consequences. The insurance industry is cyclical. Rates and profits fluctuate depending on the phase of the cycle, particularly in commercial coverages. The profitability cycle may be somewhat different for different types of insurance. The cycle of the early and mid-1980s was among the most severe that the industry has experienced. That cycle centered on liability insurance. The most recent hard market began early in about 2001 and peaked in early 2004. The industry has been experiencing a soft market due to the poor economy. While there had been some indication that rates were flattening out, industry analysts expect to soft market to continue well into 2010.", "OperationalPageNumber": 52, "PageNumber": 45, "Header": "Insurance Topics Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Insurance Topics Financial and Market Conditions Auto Insurance", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Financial and Market Conditions -> The Insurance Cycle:", "Text": "The property/casualty insurance industry has exhibited cyclical behavior for many years, as far back as the 1920s. These cycles are char- acterized by periods of rising rates leading to increased profitability. Following a period of solid but not spectacular rates of return, the industry enters a down phase where prices soften, supply of insurance becomes plentiful and, eventu- ally, profitability diminishes or vanishes completely. In the cycle\u2019s down phase, as results deteriorate, the basic ability of insurance companies to underwrite new business or, for some companies even to renew some existing policies, can be impaired because the capital needed to support the underwriting of risk has been depleted through losses. Cycles vary in their severity. The insurance industry cycle is not unlike the cycle that occurs in agri- culture, for example, in the wheat and beef markets. Demand for the product in both industries is relatively stable and is relatively unresponsive to price changes, while supply can vary from year to year. This means that when supply increases, lowering the price will not instantly \u201cclear\u201d the market of excess sup- ply. If the price of auto insurance is cut in half, people will still buy only one policy, although they may increase the amount of coverage they purchase. In the 1950s and 1960s cycles were regular, with a three-year period of soft pricing followed by a three-year period of hard pricing in practically all lines of property/casualty insurance. In the 1970s and 1980s, there were only two cycles, one mainly affecting auto insurance in the mid-1970s and the other in the mid-1980s, affecting commercial liability insurance. The commercial liabil- ity insurance cycle gave rise to the \u201cliability crisis,\u201d when certain types of com- mercial liability coverages, such as insurance for daycare centers, municipalities, ski resorts and any establishment selling liquor, became difficult to obtain.

It has three mandates: to provide residential and commercial insurance coverage for flood damage, to improve floodplain management and to develop maps of flood hazard zones. While the comprehensive section of an auto insurance policy covers flood damage to vehicles, there is no coverage for flooding in standard homeowners, renters or commercial property insurance policies. It is available in a separate policy from the NFIP and from a few private insurers. Despite efforts to publi- cize this, many people exposed to the risk of floods still fail to purchase flood insurance. It was the widespread flooding associated with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 that drew attention to the NFIP and set in motion debate about how to improve it. So far, Congress has not taken steps to significantly revamp the program. Federal flood insurance is only available where local governments have adopted adequate flood plain management regulations for their floodplain areas as set out by NFIP. About 20,400 communities across the country participate in the program. NFIP coverage is also available outside of the high-hazard areas. The NFIP law was amended in 1969 to provide coverage for mudslides and again in 1973. Until then, the purchase of flood insurance had been voluntary, with only about one million policies in force. The 1973 amendment put con- straints on the use of federal funds in high-risk floodplains, a measure that was expected to lead to almost universal flood coverage in these zones. The law pro- hibits lenders that are federally regulated, supervised or insured by federal agen- cies from lending money on a property in a floodplain zone when a community is participating in the NFIP, unless the property is covered by flood insurance. Legislation was enacted in 1994 to tighten enforcement of flood insurance requirements. Regulators can now fine banks with a pattern of failure to enforce the law and lenders can purchase flood insurance on behalf of homeowners who fail to buy it themselves, then bill them for coverage. The law includes a provision that denies federal disaster aid to people who have been flooded twice and have failed to purchase insurance after the first flood. Buildings constructed in a floodplain after a community has met regula- tions must conform to elevation requirements. When repair, reconstruction or improvement to an older building equals or exceeds 50 percent of its market value, the structure must be updated to conform to current building codes. A 2007 NFIP study on the benefits of elevating buildings showed that due to significantly lower premiums homeowners can usually recover the higher con- struction costs in less than five years for homes built in a \u201cvelocity\u201d zone, where the structure is likely to be subject to wave damage, and in five to 15 years in a standard flood zone. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) esti- mates that buildings constructed to NFIP standards suffer about 80 percent less damage annually that those not built in compliance.", "OperationalPageNumber": "54, 55", "PageNumber": "47, 48", "Header": "Insurance Topics Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Insurance Topics Flood Insurance Auto Insurance, Insurance Topics Flood Insurance Auto Insurance Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Flood Insurance -> How It Works:", "Text": "The NFIP is administered by FEMA, now part of the Depart- ment of Homeland Security. Flood insurance was initially only available through insurance agents who dealt directly with the federal program. The direct\u201d policy program has been supplemented since 1983 with a private/public cooperative arrangement, known as \u201cWrite Your Own,\u201d through which a pool of insurance companies issue policies and adjust flood claims on behalf of the federal government under their own names, charging the same premium as the direct program. Participating insurers receive an expense allowance for policies written and claims processed. The federal government retains responsibility for underwriting losses. Today, most policies are issued through the Write-Your- Own program but some nonfederally backed coverage is available from the pri- vate market. The NFIP is expected to be self-supporting (i.e., premiums are set at an actuarially sound level) in an average loss year, as reflected in past experience. In an extraordinary year, as Hurricane Katrina demonstrated, losses can greatly exceed premiums, leaving the NFIP with a huge debt to the U.S. Treasury that it is unlikely to be able to pay back. Hurricane Katrina losses and the percentage of flood damage that was uninsured led to calls for a revamping of the entire flood program. As with other types of insurance, rates for flood insurance are based on the degree of risk. FEMA assesses flood risk for all the participating communities, resulting in the publication of thousands of individual flood rate maps. High- risk areas are known as Special Flood Hazard Areas, or SFHAs. Flood plain maps are redrawn periodically, removing some properties previ- ously designated as high hazard and adding new ones. New technology enables flood mitigation programs to more accurately pinpoint areas vulnerable to flooding. As development in and around flood plains increases, run off patterns can change, causing flooding in areas that were formerly not considered high risk and vice versa. People tend to underestimate the risk of flooding. The highest-risk areas Zone A) have an annual flood risk of 1 percent and a 26 percent chance of flooding over the lifetime of a 30-year mortgage, compared with a 9 percent risk of fire over the same period. In addition, people who live in areas adjacent to high-risk zones may still be exposed to floods on occasion. Ninety percent of all natural disasters in this country involve flooding, the NFIP says. Since the incep- tion of the federal program, some 25 to 30 percent of all paid losses were for damage in areas not officially designated at the time of loss as special flood haz- ard areas. NFIP coverage is available outside high-risk zones at a lower premium. To prevent people putting off the purchase of coverage until waters are rising and flooding is inevitable, policyholders must wait 30 days before their policy takes effect. In 1993, 7,800 policies purchased at the last minute resulted in $48 million in claims against only $625,000 in premiums.", "OperationalPageNumber": "55, 56", "PageNumber": "48, 49", "Header": "Insurance Topics Flood Insurance Auto Insurance Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates, Insurance Topics Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Insurance Topics Flood Insurance Auto Insurance", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Flood Insurance -> Proposals for Change:", "Text": "The NFIP has four major goals: to decrease the risk of flood losses; reduce the costs and consequences of flooding; reduce the demand for federal assistance; and preserve and restore beneficial floodplain functions. In a final report published in 2006 by the American Institutes for Research AIR), which conducted an evaluation of the federal flood insurance program, AIR said that although much had been accomplished, the program fell short of meeting its goals in part because the NFIP did not have the ability to guide development away from floodplains and cannot restore beneficial floodplain functions once they have been impaired. In addition, AIR said, many people still are not covered or not adequately covered for flood damage. AIR also noted that the NFIP was hampered in reaching its goals by insufficient Congressional funding, lack of pertinent data, misperceptions about the nature of the program and the breakdown in coordination among its three major sectors. A report published by FEMA in 2007 suggests that development patterns should be changed to protect environmentally sensitive areas and that commu- nities in the flood program should be encouraged or required to ban develop- ment in these locations. Another criticism of the NFIP is that it does not charge enough for cover- age. Among the reasons for the premium shortfall is that the cost of coverage on dwellings that were built before floodplain management regulations were established in their communities is subsidized. As a result, the premiums paid for flood coverage by the owners of these properties reflect only 30 to 40 per- cent of the true risk of loss. In January 2006 FEMA estimated an annual shortfall in premium income of $750 million due to these subsidies. Some subsidized properties also suffer repetitive losses. Repetitive loss properties accounted for about $4.6 billion in claims payments between 1978 and 2004.

This fraud results in higher premiums. Fraud may be committed at different points in the insurance transaction by different parties: applicants for insurance, policyholders, third-party claimants and professionals who provide services to claimants. Common frauds include padding,\u201d or inflating actual claims; misrepresenting facts on an insurance application; submitting claims for injuries or damage that never occurred; and staging\u201d accidents. Prompted by the incidence of insurance fraud, 41 states and the District of Columbia have set up fraud bureaus (some bureaus have limited powers, and some states have more than one bureau to address fraud in different lines of insurance). These agencies have reported increases in referrals (tips about sus- pected fraud), cases opened, convictions and court-ordered restitution. Insurance fraud can be \u201chard\u201d or \u201csoft.\u201d Hard fraud occurs when someone deliberately fabricates claims or fakes an accident. Soft insurance fraud, also known as opportunistic fraud, occurs when people pad legitimate claims, for example, or, in the case of business owners, list fewer employees or misrepresent the work they do to pay lower workers compensation premiums. People who commit insurance fraud range from organized criminals, who steal large sums through fraudulent business activities and insurance claim mills, to professionals and technicians, who inflate the cost of services or charge for services not rendered, to ordinary people who want to cover their deductible or view filing a claim as an opportunity to make a little money. Some lines of insurance are more vulnerable to fraud than others. Healthcare, workers compensation and auto insurance are believed to be the sectors most affected. Insurance fraud received little attention until the 1980s when the rising price of insurance and the growth in organized fraud spurred efforts to pass stronger antifraud laws. Allied with insurers were parties affected by fraud\u2014 consumers who pay higher insurance premiums to compensate for losses from fraud; direct victims of organized fraud groups; and chiropractors and other medical professionals who are concerned that their reputations will be tar- nished. One out of five Americans think it is acceptable to defraud insurance com- panies under certain conditions, according to the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud. The organization released the findings in a 2008 study, \u201cThe Four Faces of Insurance Fraud.\u201d It found that the public is consistently more tolerant of specific insurance frauds today than it was 10 years before. In addition, studies by the Insurance Research Council show that significant numbers of Americans think it is all right to inflate their insurance claims to make up for insurance premiums they have paid in previous years when they have had no claims or to pad a claim to make up for the deductible they would have to pay. Insurers must preserve the fine line between investigating suspicious claims and harassing legitimate claimants and the need to comply with the time requirements for paying claims imposed by fair claim practice regulations. All states have unfair claim settlement practice laws on their books to ensure that the parties involved are informed of the progress of investigations and that investigators settle the claim promptly or within a specified amount of time. About 19 states have provisions that provide guidance and protection for inves- tigators by allowing time limit extensions or waivers and detailing what evi- dence is required and to whom the evidence should be made available.", "OperationalPageNumber": "57, 58", "PageNumber": "50, 51", "Header": "Insurance Topics Insurance Fraud Auto Insurance Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates, Insurance Topics Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Insurance Topics Insurance Fraud Auto Insurance", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Insurance Fraud -> Insurers\u2019 Antifraud Measures:", "Text": "The legal options of an insurance company that suspects fraud are limited.

To that end most insurers have estab- lished special investigation units (SIUs). These entities help identify and investi- gate suspicious claims. Insurers have also created a national fraud academy.

U.S. consumers pay directly for the high cost of going to court through higher liability insurance premiums because lia- bility insurance rates reflect what insurance companies pay out for their policy- holders\u2019 legal defense and any judgments against them. And they pay indirectly in higher prices for goods and services since businesses pass on to consumers the expenses they incur in protecting themselves against lawsuits, including the cost of commercial liability insurance. Beginning in the 1980s, in an effort to reduce litigation costs, business groups and others mounted a campaign to reform tort law. Tort law is the basis for the U.S. liability system. Most reforms have taken place on the state level and during the last decade all but a handful of states passed significant tort law reforms. However, some have been overturned by the courts. Many reform efforts have focused on medical malpractice issues. Medical malpractice insurance covers doctors and other professionals in the medical field for liability claims arising from their treatment of patients. The cost of medical malpractice insurance began to rise in the early 2000s after a period of essentially flat prices. Rate increases were precipitated in part by the growing size of claims, particularly in urban areas. Among the other factors driving up prices was a reduced supply of available coverage as several major insurers exited the medical malpractice business because of the difficulty of making a profit. New research suggests that premium increases may be moderating but, for any significant turnaround to take root, major reforms in the delivery of medi- cal care that focus on patient safety need to occur, industry observers say.

Microinsurance products tend to be much less costly than traditional products and thus extend protection to a much wider market. The approach is an out- growth of the microfinancing projects developed by Bangladeshi Nobel Prize- winning banker and economist Muhammad Yunus, which helped millions of low-income individuals in Asia and Africa to set up businesses and buy houses. American International Group Inc. (AIG) was one of the first companies to offer microinsurance and began selling policies in Uganda in 1997. Swiss Re, Munich Re, Allianz and Zurich Financial Services have also entered the microinsurance arena. Disasters such as the 2005 tsunami in Indonesia and the 2010 Haiti earth- quake have demonstrated the need for insurance in many regions, prompting insurers to develop new products. While the coverage is often geared to protec- tion from natural disasters, there are also programs covering life/health risks as well. With limited growth prospects in the insurance markets of developed countries, which are largely saturated, insurers see microinsurance in emerging economies as presenting significant potential for growth and profitability.

The major differences are whether there are restrictions on the right to sue and whether the policyholder\u2019s own insurer pays first-party benefits, up to the state maximum amount, regardless of who is at fault in the accident. These alternative systems have evolved over time as con- sumers, regulators and insurers have sought ways to lower the cost and speed up the delivery of compensation for auto accidents. The term \u201cno-fault\u201d auto insurance is often used loosely to denote any auto insurance program that allows policyholders to recover financial losses from their own insurance company, regardless of fault. But in its strictest form no- fault applies only to state laws that both provide for the payment of no-fault first-party benefits and restrict the right to sue, the so-called \u201climited tort\u201d option. The first-party (policyholder) benefit coverage is known as personal injury protection (PIP). Under current no-fault laws, motorists may sue for severe injuries and for pain and suffering only if the case meets certain conditions. These conditions, known as a threshold, relate to the severity of injury. They may be expressed in verbal terms (a descriptive or verbal threshold) or in dollar amounts of medical bills, a monetary threshold. Some laws also include minimum requirements for the days of disability incurred as a result of the accident. Because high threshold no-fault systems restrict litigation, they tend to reduce costs and delays in pay- ing claims. Verbal thresholds eliminate the incentive to inflate claims that may exist when there is a dollar \u201ctarget\u201d for medical expenses. However, in some states the verbal threshold has been eroded over time by broad judicial interpre- tation of the verbal threshold language, and PIP coverage has become the target of abuse and fraud by dishonest doctors and clinics that bill for unnecessary and expensive medical procedures, pushing up costs. Currently 12 states and Puerto Rico have no-fault auto insurance laws. Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania have verbal thresholds. The other seven states\u2014Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Dakota and Utah\u2014use a monetary threshold. Three states have a \u201cchoice\u201d no-fault law.

The move to modernize insur- ance regulation is being driven in part by the globalization of insurance services. Some large U.S. companies that operate in other countries support the concept of a federal system that provides one-stop regulatory approval while others believe the merits of a state system outweigh the virtues of a single national regulator. As a result of discussions about the merits of each system, states are making it easier for insurers to respond quickly to market forces. States monitor insurance company solvency. One important function related to this is oversee- ing rate changes. Rate making is the process of calculating a price to cover the future cost of insurance claims and expenses, including a margin for profit. To establish rates, insurers look at past trends and changes in the current environ- ment that may affect potential losses in the future. Rates are not the same as premiums. A rate is the price of a given unit of insurance\u2014$2.50 per $1,000 of earthquake coverage, for example. The premium represents the total cost of many units. If the price to rebuild a house is $150,000, the premium would be 150 x $2.50. Rates vary according to the likelihood and potential size of loss. Using the example of earthquake insurance, rates would be higher near a fault line and for a brick house, which is more susceptible to damage, than a frame one. While the regulatory processes in each state vary, three principles guide every state\u2019s rate regulation system: that rates be adequate (to maintain insur- ance company solvency), but not excessive (not so high as to lead to exorbitant profits), nor unfairly discriminatory (price differences must reflect expected claim and expense differences). Recently, in auto and home insurance, the twin issues of availability and affordability, which are not explicitly included in the guiding principles, have been assuming greater importance in regulatory decisions. In line with these principles, states have adopted various methods of regu- lating insurance rates, which fall roughly into two categories: \u201cprior approval\u201d and \u201ccompetitive.\u201d This does not mean there is no competition in states using a prior approval system. Most approved rates in prior approval states are the rates used, but in some cases, particularly in commercial coverages, companies com- pete at rates below these approved ceilings. Regulation Modernization Increasingly, even in the most regulated states, officials are relying on competi- tion among insurance companies to keep rates down and are modernizing and streamlining the rate setting process. The move to modernize insurance regulation is being driven in part by the globalization of insurance services. Some large U.S. companies that operate in other countries support the concept of a federal system that provides one-stop regulatory approval while others believe the merits of a state system outweigh the virtues of a single national regulator. As a result of discussions about the merits of each system, states are making it easier for insurers to respond quickly to market forces. Since 2009, various pieces of legislation have been introduced in Congress that respond to a number of concerns: lack of an entity at the fed- eral level that can represent insurance interests, particularly in the discussion of international issues; the need for better oversight of systemic risk\u2014the inter- connectedness of the risk assumed by a few large financial services companies whose failure could bring down the entire financial system; and the need to streamline the regulation of reinsurers and surplus lines insurers. For example, in Georgia, a law was signed in May 2008 that allows auto insurance companies to adjust most rates without the prior approval of the insurance commissioner.

It is a way of transferring or \u201cceding\u201d some of the financial risk insurance companies assume in insur- ing cars, homes and businesses to another insurance company, the reinsurer. Reinsurance, a highly complex global business, accounted for about 9 percent of the U.S. property/casualty insurance industry premiums in 2008, according to the Reinsurance Association of America. The reinsurance business is evolving. Traditionally, reinsurance transactions were between two insurance entities: the primary insurer that sold the original insurance policies and the reinsurer. Most still are. Primary insurers and reinsur- ers can share both the premiums and losses or reinsurers may assume the pri- mary company\u2019s losses above a certain dollar limit in return for a fee. However, risks of various kinds, particularly of natural disasters, are now being sold by insurers and reinsurers to institutional investors in the form of catastrophe bonds and other alternative risk-spreading mechanisms. Increasingly, new prod- ucts reflect a gradual blending of reinsurance and investment banking. After Hurricane Andrew hit Southern Florida in 1992, causing $15.5 billion in insured losses at the time, it became clear that U.S. insurers had seriously underestimated the extent of their liability for property losses in a megadisas- ter. Until Hurricane Andrew, the industry had thought $8 billion was the larg- est possible catastrophe loss. Reinsurers subsequently reassessed their position, which in turn caused primary companies to reconsider their catastrophe reinsur- ance needs. The shortage and high cost of traditional catastrophe reinsurance precipi- tated by Hurricane Andrew and declining interest rates, which sent investors looking for higher yields, prompted interest in securitization of insurance risk. Among the precursors to catastrophe bonds and other forms of securitiza- tion were contingency financing bonds such as those issued for the Florida Windstorm Association in 1996, which provided cash in the event of a catastro- phe but had to be repaid after a loss, and contingent surplus notes\u2014an agree- ment with a bank or other lender that in the event of a megadisaster that would significantly reduce policyholders\u2019 surplus, funds would be made available at a predetermined price. Funds to pay for the transaction should money be needed, are held in U.S. Treasuries. Surplus notes are not considered debt, therefore do not hamper an insurer\u2019s ability to write additional insurance. In addition, there were equity puts, through which an insurer would receive a sum of money in the event of a catastrophic loss in exchange for stock or other options. A catastrophe bond is a specialized security, introduced in 1997, that increases insurers\u2019 ability to provide insurance protection by transferring the risk to bond investors. Commercial banks and other lenders have been securitiz- ing mortgages for years, freeing up capital to expand their mortgage business. Insurers and reinsurers issue catastrophe bonds to the securities market through an issuer known as a special purpose reinsurance vehicle (SPRV) set up specifi- cally for this purpose. These bonds have complicated structures and are typically created offshore where tax and regulatory treatment may be more favorable. SPRVs collect the premium from the insurance or reinsurance company and the principal from investors and hold them in a trust in the form of U.S. Treasuries or other highly rated assets, using the investment income to pay interest on the principal. Catastrophe bonds pay high interest rates but if the trigger event occurs, investors lose the interest and sometimes the principal, depending on the structure of the bond, both of which may be used to cover the insurer\u2019s disaster losses. Bonds may be issued for a one-year term or multiple years, often three. The field has gradually evolved to the point where some investors and insurance company issuers are beginning to feel comfortable with the concept, with some coming back to the capital markets each year. In addition to the high interest rates catastrophe bonds pay, their attraction to investors is that they diversify investment portfolio risk, thus reducing the volatility of returns. The returns on most other securities are tied to economic activity rather than natu- ral disasters. Catastrophe bonds have evolved into a multibillion dollar industry. Though pioneered by reinsurers, primary insurers now frequently sponsor new issues. In addition to catastrophe bonds, catastrophe options were developed but the market for these options never took off. Another alternative is the exchange of risk where individual companies in different parts of the world swap a certain amount of losses. Payment is triggered by the occurrence of an agreed upon event at a certain level of magnitude.", "OperationalPageNumber": "67, 68", "PageNumber": "60, 61", "Header": "Insurance Topics Reinsurance Auto Insurance Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates, Insurance Topics Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Insurance Topics Reinsurance Auto Insurance", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Residual Markets", "Text": "In a normal competitive market, insurers are free to select from among people applying for insurance those drivers, property owners and commercial opera- tions they wish to insure. They do this by evaluating the risks involved through a process called underwriting. Applicants who are considered \u201chigh risk\u201d may have difficulty obtaining insurance through the regular \u201cvoluntary\u201d market channels. (The term \u201chigh risk\u201d applies to individuals or individual businesses with a poor loss record due to inadequate safety measures; certain kinds of businesses or professions where the nature of the work is hazardous or where the risk of lawsuits is high; and specific locations where the risk of theft, vandalism or severe storm damage is substantial.) To make basic coverage more readily available to everyone who wants or needs insurance, special insurance plans have been set up by state regulators working with the insurance industry. The business that insurers do not voluntarily assume is called the residual market. Residual markets may also be called \u201cshared,\u201d because the profits and losses of each type of residual market are shared by all insurers in the state sell- ing that type of insurance, or involuntary, because insurers do not choose to underwrite the business, in contrast to the regular voluntary market. Residual market programs are rarely self-sufficient. Where the rates charged to high-risk policyholders are too low to support the program\u2019s operation, insur- ers are generally assessed to make up the difference. These additional costs are typically passed on to all insurance consumers. However, in a few states, insur- ers are not able to recoup their residual market losses and political pressure pre- vents rates from rising to the level they should be actuarially. The number of drivers and properties insured in the residual market fluctu- ates as lawmakers and regulators change laws or address availability, rate ade- quacy and other factors that influence underwriting decisions. The Automobile Residual Market The first of the residual market mechanisms for automobile coverage was estab- lished in New Hampshire in 1938. As states began to pass laws requiring drivers to furnish proof of insurance, having auto liability insurance became a prereq- uisite for driving a car. Today, all 50 states and the District of Columbia use one of four systems to guarantee that auto insurance is available to those who need it. All four systems are commonly known as assigned risk plans, although the term technically applies only to the first type of plan, where each insurer is required to assume its share of residual market policyholders or \u201crisks.\u201d (The term \u201crisk\u201d is used in the insurance industry to denote the policyholder or prop- erty insured as well as the chance of loss.)

When agents or company representatives are unable to obtain auto insur- ance for an applicant in the voluntary market, they submit the application to the assigned risk plan office. These applications are distributed randomly by the automobile insurance plan to all insurance companies that offer automobile liability coverage in the state in proportion to the amount of their voluntary business. Thus, if on a given day the plan receives 100 applications from agents around the state, a company with 10 percent of that state\u2019s regular private pas- senger automobile insurance business will be assigned 10 of those applicants and will be responsible for all associated losses.

Established between 1969 and 1971, Beach and Windstorm Plans operate in a manner similar to FAIR Plans, except that properties must be locat- ed in a designated area to be eligible for insurance under the Plans. There are currently five Beach and Windstorm Plans: Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, North Carolina and Texas. In 2001 there were seven pools, but Florida\u2019s windstorm pool merged with the joint underwriting association in 2002 to create a new type of residual market entity, see below. In a similar move in 2003, Louisiana merged its FAIR Plan with its coastal pool. The Plans are mandatory in all of these states with the exception of Alabama. (In addition, hail and windstorm coverage for homes in coastal counties is available through some FAIR Plans, see above and the WindMap in New Jersey.) Windstorm Plans in Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas offer only wind and hail coverage. Plans in Alabama and North Carolina offer coverage for fire as well. In some states, Plan policyholders must buy flood insurance also. Property owners who live in areas covered by Beach and Windstorm Plans may be insured for windstorm losses by the Plan or by an individual insur- ance company. If an insurer has accepted all the windstorm risk it is prepared to assume, an applicant for homeowners insurance may purchase a policy that excludes windstorm coverage from the homeowners insurance company and pay a separate premium for windstorm coverage to the Plan. One disadvantage of Beach and Windstorm Plans, and the National Flood Insurance Program, is that the availability of insurance encourages development of coastal areas where construction otherwise would not be feasible and where tax money must be spent to protect against continuous erosion to preserve the property. In the past there was a clear delineation between coastal and urban plans with coastal properties insured under Beach and Windstorm Plans, and urban properties under FAIR Plans. Increasingly, the distinctions are blurring. FAIR Plans are acting as an insurer of last resort for residents who live in shoreline communities in states that do not have a Beach and Windstorm Plan, such as New York State. Beach and Windstorm Plans in some states are being merged with FAIR Plans or joint underwriting associations, as in Florida and Louisiana, or are administering new FAIR Plans, as in Texas. As a result, it is difficult to compare the number of properties insured under any Plan with numbers from earlier years.

After September 11, which costs insurers about $31.6 billion, insurers began to reassess the risk. For a while terrorism coverage was scarce. Reinsurers were unwilling to reinsure pol- icies in urban areas perceived to be vulnerable to attack. Primary insurers filed requests with their state insurance departments for permission to exclude terror- ism coverage from their commercial policies. Concerned about the limited availability of terrorism coverage in high- risk areas and its impact on the economy, Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA). The Act provides a temporary program that, in the event of major terrorist attack, allows the insurance industry and federal government to share losses according to a specific formula. TRIA was signed into law on November 26, 2002 and renewed again for two years in December 2005. Passage of TRIA enabled a market for terrorism insurance to begin to develop because the federal backstop effectively limits insurers\u2019 losses, greatly simplifying the underwriting process.

To be readily insurable, risks have to have certain characteristics. The risk must be measurable. Insurers must be able to determine the pos- sible or probable number of events (frequency) likely to result in claims and the maximum size or cost (severity) of these events. For example, insurers know from experience about how many car crashes to expect per 100,000 miles driven for any geographic area and what these crashes are likely to cost. As a result they can charge a premium equal to the risk they are assuming in issuing an auto insurance policy. A large number of people or businesses must be exposed to the risk of loss but only a few must actually experience one so that the premiums of those that do not file claims can fund the losses of those who do. Losses must be random as regards time, location and magnitude. Insofar as acts of terrorism are intentional, terrorism risk does not have these characteristics. In addition, no one knows what the worst case scenario might be. There have been very few terrorist attacks, so there is little data on which to base estimates of future losses, either in terms of frequency or severity. Terrorism losses are also likely to be concentrated geographically, since terrorism is usually targeted to produce a significant economic or psychological impact. This leads to a situation known in the insurance industry as adverse selection, where only the people most at risk purchase coverage, the same people who are likely to file claims. Moreover, terrorism losses are never random. They are care- fully planned and often coordinated.", "OperationalPageNumber": "76, 77", "PageNumber": "69, 70", "Header": "Insurance Topics Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Insurance Topics Terrorism Risk and Insurance Auto Insurance, Insurance Topics Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Terrorism Risk and Insurance Auto Insurance", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Terrorism Risk and Insurance -> Assessing Risk:", "Text": "To underwrite terrorism insurance\u2014to decide whether to offer coverage and what price to charge\u2014insurers must be able to quantify the risk: the likelihood of an event and the amount of damage it would cause. Increas- ingly, they are using sophisticated modeling tools to assess this risk. According to the modeling firm, AIR Worldwide, the way terrorism risk is measured is not much different from assessments of natural disaster risk, except that the data used for terrorism are more subject to uncertainty. It is easier to project the risk of damage in a particular location from an earthquake of a given intensity or a Category 5 hurricane than a terrorist attack because insurers have had so much more experience with natural disasters than with terrorist attacks and therefore the data to incorporate into models are readily available. One problem insurers face is the accumulation of risk. They need to know not only the likelihood and extent of damage to a particular building but also the company\u2019s accumulated risk from insuring multiple buildings within a given geographical area, including the implications of fire following a terrorist attack. In addition, in the United States, workers compensation insurers face concentra- tions of risk from injuries to workers caused by terrorism attacks.

However, when the Act came up for renewal in 2005 and in 2007, there were some who believed that market forces should be allowed to deal with the problem. Both the U.S. Government Accountability Office and the President\u2019s Working Group on Financial Markets published reports on terrorism insurance in September 2006. The two reports essentially supported the insurance indus- try in its evaluation of nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (NBCR) risk\u2014that it is uninsurable\u2014but unlike the insurance industry, the President\u2019s Working Group said that the existence of TRIA has negatively affected the development of a more robust market for terrorism insurance, a point on which the industry disagrees. TRIA is the reason that coverage is available, insurers say. The structure of the program has encouraged the development of reinsurance for the layers of risk that insurers must bear themselves\u2014deductible amounts and coinsurance\u2014which in turn allows primary insurers to provide coverage. TRIA and its extensions authorized the creation of a federal reinsurance plan, which is triggered when insured terrorism losses exceed a predetermined amount. The program, a sharing of losses between the insurance industry and the federal government according to a preset formula\u2014a type of reinsurance\u2014 has enabled the commercial insurance market to function, even though the threat of terrorism remains. The law defines an act of terrorism under the 2007 amendment. To be cov- ered by the federal program, an act of terrorism must be committed by individu- als acting as part of an effort to influence the policy or conduct of the United States. The law also requires that the act be certified by the Secretary of the Treasury in concurrence with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General. Insurers do not pay the federal government for this reinsurance coverage. Only commercial insurers and causes of losses specified in the underlying policies are covered. In addition to commercial lines insurers, insurers eligible for coverage include residual market entities such as workers compensation pools, state-licensed captive insurers and risk retention groups, see report on captives. Personal lines insurance companies\u2014those that sell auto and home insurance\u2014and reinsurers are not covered. Neither are group life insurance losses. Most types of commercial insurance losses were covered under the origi- nal legislation, except some specialty coverages such as medical malpractice and crop insurance. Some commercial insurance coverages were deleted under the 2005 extension including commercial auto insurance, professional liabil- ity except for directors and officers liability, surety, burglary and theft and farmowners multiperil, a coverage similar to homeowners. In return for the federal backstop, commercial insurers must make terrorism coverage available and conspicuously state the premium charges; policyhold- ers can reject the offer and choose to mitigate this class of risk in other ways. In offering terrorism coverage to their policyholders, commercial insurers must make it available on the same terms and conditions as they offer in their non- TRIA coverage. After September 11, to minimize the likelihood of a wave of liability claims, Congress established the Federal Victims Compensation Act, which provided nearly $7 billion in payments to families of September 11 victims. In return, vic- tims\u2019 families were required to give up the right to sue those they perceived as responsible parties.

Workers compensation systems vary from state to state. State statutes and court decisions control many aspects, including the handling of claims, the evaluation of impairment and settlement of disputes, the amount of benefits injured workers receive and the strategies used to control costs. Workers compensation costs are one of the many factors that influence businesses to expand or relocate in a state, generating jobs. When premiums rise sharply, legislators often call for reforms. The last round of widespread reform legislation started in the late 1980s.

At that time, the only way injured workers could obtain compensation was to sue their employers for negligence. Proving negligence was a costly, time-consuming effort, and often the court ruled in favor of the employer. But by the early 1900s, a state-by-state pattern of legisla- tive proposals designed to compensate injured workers had begun to emerge. Wisconsin enacted the first permanent workers compensation insurance law in 1911 (New York had enacted a law a year earlier but it was found unconsti- tutional), and by 1920 all but eight states had enacted similar laws. By 1949 all states had a workers compensation system that provided compensation to work- ers hurt on the job, regardless of who was at fault. The costs of medical treat- ment and wage loss benefits were the responsibility of the employer which were paid through the workers compensation system. The scope of workers compensation coverage has broadened consider- ably since its early beginnings. In 1972, states amended their laws to meet performance standards recommended by the National Commission on State Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws. Many states took action not only to expand benefits but also to make the coverage applicable to classifications of employees not previously covered. However, compensation levels are not uniform. In some states benefits are still inadequate, while in others, they are overly generous. Some states were slow in adopting the National Commission\u2019s guidelines and have still not embraced the entire package of 19 recommendations published in 1972. Many states exempt employers with only a few workers (fewer than five, four or three, depending on the state) from mandatory coverage laws. A major benefits issue still to be resolved in some states is the imbalance between levels of compensa- tion for various degrees of impairment; permanent partial disabilities tend to be overcompensated and permanent total disability undercompensated. Some coverage for workers compensation is provided by federal programs. For example, the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers Compensation Act, passed in 1927 and substantially amended in 1984, provides coverage for certain maritime employees and the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act protects workers hired by the U.S. government. Employers can purchase workers compensation coverage from private insur- ance companies or state-run workers agencies, known as state funds. In 14 states, state funds compete with private insurers (competitive funds) and in four states, the state is the sole provider of workers compensation insurance. State funds also function as the insurer of last resort for businesses that have diffi- culty getting coverage in the open market. The only state in which workers compensation coverage is truly optional is Texas, where about one-third of the state\u2019s employers are so-called nonsubscrib- ers. Those that opt out of the system can be sued by employees for failure to provide a safe workplace. The nonsubscribers tend to be smaller companies, but the percentage of larger companies opting out has been growing. Some businesses finance their own workplace injury benefits through a system known as self-insurance. Large organizations with many employees can often estimate the cost of routine types of injuries. Self-insurance, along with large deductibles, which are in effect self-insurance, now account for more than one-third of traditional market premium. About nine out of 10 people in the nation\u2019s workforce are protected by workers compensation insurance.", "OperationalPageNumber": "80, 81", "PageNumber": "73, 74", "Header": "Insurance Topics Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Insurance Topics Workers Compensation Auto Insurance, Insurance Topics Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Workers Compensation Auto Insurance", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Workers Compensation -> How the System Works:", "Text": "Workers compensation systems are administered by the individual states, generally by commissions or boards whose responsibility it is to ensure compliance with the laws, investigate and decide disputed cases, and collect data. In most states employers are required to keep records of acci- dents. Accidents must be reported to the workers compensation board and to the company\u2019s insurer within a specified number of days. Workers compensation covers an injured worker\u2019s medical care and attempts to cover his or her economic loss. This includes loss of earnings and the extra expenses associated with the injury. Injured workers receive all medi- cally necessary and appropriate treatment from the first day of injury or illness and rehabilitation when the disability is severe. To rein in expenditures and improve cost effectiveness, many states have adopted cost control measures, including treatment guidelines that spell out acceptable treatments and diagnostic tests for specific injuries such as lower back injuries and fee schedules that set maximum payment amounts to doctors for certain types of care. Most claims are medical only, but lost-time claims, those with both medi- cal and lost income payments, though few, consume most resources. Claims are categorized according to the degree of impairment\u2014partial or total disabil- ity\u2014and whether the impairment is permanent or temporary. Cash benefits can include impairment benefits and, when the impairment causes a loss of income, disability or wage loss benefits. Impairment can be defined in several ways. Payments may be based on a schedule or list of body parts covered and the benefits paid for a loss of that part. For injuries not on the schedule, benefit payments may be calculated according to the degree of impairment or the loss of future or current earnings capacity, often using the American Medical Association\u2019s definitions. Most states pay benefits for the duration of the injury. But some specify a maximum number of weeks, particularly for temporary disabilities. For workers with a total disability, the benefit amount is some percentage of the worker\u2019s weekly wage (actual or state average). Cash benefits may not be paid until after a waiting period of several days.", "OperationalPageNumber": 82, "PageNumber": 75, "Header": "Insurance Topics Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Updates at www.iii.org/issues_updates Insurance Topics Workers Compensation Auto Insurance", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Workers Compensation -> Costs to Employers:", "Text": "Costs to employers include premiums, payments made under deductibles and the benefits and administrative costs incurred by employ- ers that self-insure or fund their own benefit program.

Reforms are implemented and then, over time, one or more elements in these multifaceted systems get out of balance. Some employers and legislators com- plain that the cost of coverage is hurting the state\u2019s economy by reducing its ability to compete with other states for new job-producing opportunities. In the 1980s, with a view to increasing competition within the insurance industry in order to bring down rates, legislation was introduced in more than a dozen states to change the method of establishing rates from administered pric- ing, where rating organizations recommended rates that included expenses and a margin for profit, to open competition. Now insurers base their rate filings on more of their own company\u2019s specific data, rather than using industrywide figures in such areas as expenses and profit and contingency allowances. Rating organizations still provide industrywide data on \u201closses\u201d\u2014the costs associated with work-related accidents, which help small companies that lack access to large amounts of data. The aim of the workers compensation system is to help workers recover from work-related accidents and illnesses and to return to the workplace. A fast return to work is desirable from the employer and insurer\u2019s viewpoint, lowering claim costs for the insurer but benefiting the worker too. Another factor pushing up costs in some states is the amount of attorney involvement. Workers compensation programs were originally intended to be no-fault\u201d systems and therefore litigation-free. However today, attorneys are involved in 5 to 10 percent of all workers compensation claims in most states\u2014but in as much as 20 percent in systems where the number of disputes is high and in roughly a third of claims where the worker was injured seriously. Although attorney involvement boosts claim costs by 12 to 15 percent, because claimants must pay attorneys\u2019 fees there is generally no net gain in the actual benefits received. The involvement of an attorney does not necessar- ily indicate formal litigation proceedings. Sometimes, injured workers turn to attorneys to help them negotiate what they believe is a confusing and complex system. Increasingly, states are trying to make the system easier to understand and to use. The workers compensation system plays a major role in improving work- place safety. An employer\u2019s workers compensation premium reflects the relative hazards to which workers are exposed and the employer\u2019s claim record.

See Dividends) ACTUAL CASH VALUE A form of insurance that pays damages equal to the replacement value of damaged property minus depreciation. ( See Replace- ment cost) ACTUARY An insurance professional skilled in the analysis, evaluation and management of statistical information. Evaluates insurance firms\u2019 reserves, determines rates and rating methods, and determines other business and financial risks. ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES Extra charges covered by homeowners poli- cies over and above the policyholder\u2019s cus- tomary living expenses. They kick in when the insured requires temporary shelter due to damage by a covered peril that makes the home temporarily uninhabitable. ADDITIONAL TERM INSURANCE OPTION An option available to owners of partici- pating insurance policies under which the insurer uses a policy dividend as a net single premium to purchase one-year term insurance on the insured\u2019s life. Also known as fifth dividend option. ( See Dividend; Policy dividend options) ADJUSTABLE LIFE INSURANCE A form of life insurance that allows policy owners to vary the type of coverage pro- vided by their policies as their insurance needs change. ADJUSTER An individual employed by a property/ca- sualty insurer to evaluate losses and settle policyholder claims. These adjusters differ from public adjusters, who negotiate with insurers on behalf of policyholders, and receive a portion of a claims settlement. Independent adjusters are independent contractors who adjust claims for different insurance companies. ADMITTED ASSETS Assets recognized and accepted by state insurance laws in determining the solvency of insurers and reinsurers. To make it easier to assess an insurance company\u2019s financial position, state statutory accounting rules do not permit certain assets to be included on the balance sheet. Only assets that can be easily sold in the event of liquidation or borrowed against, and receivables for which payment can be reasonably antici- pated, are included in admitted assets. ( See Assets) ADMITTED COMPANY An insurance company licensed and autho- rized to do business in a particular state. ADVERSE SELECTION The tendency of those exposed to a higher risk to seek more insurance coverage than those at a lower risk. Insurers react either by charging higher premiums or not insuring at all, as in the case of floods. Flood insurance is provided by the federal government but sold mostly through the private market.) In the case of natural disas- ters, such as earthquakes, adverse selection concentrates risk instead of spreading it. Insurance works best when risk is shared among large numbers of policyholders. AFFINITY SALES Selling insurance through groups such as professional and business associations. AFTERMARKET PARTS See Crash parts; Generic auto parts. AGENCY COMPANIES Companies that market and sell products via independent agents. AGENT Insurance is sold by two types of agents: independent agents, who are self-employed, represent several insurance companies and are paid on commission; and exclusive or captive agents, who represent only one insurance company and are either salaried or work on commission. Insurance compa- nies that use exclusive or captive agents are called direct writers. ALEATORY CONTRACT A contract in which one party provides something of value to another party in exchange for a conditional promise, which is a promise that the other party will perform a stated act upon the occurrence of an uncertain event. Insurance contracts are aleatory because the policyowner pays premiums to the insurer, and in return the insurer promises to pay benefits if the event insured against occurs. Contrast with Commutative contract. ALIEN INSURANCE COMPANY An insurance company incorporated under the laws of a foreign country, as opposed to a \u201cforeign\u201d insurance company which does business in states outside its own. ALLIED LINES Property insurance that is usually bought in conjunction with fire insurance; it in- cludes wind, water damage and vandalism coverage. ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION/ADR An alternative to going to court to settle disputes. Methods include arbitration, where disputing parties agree to be bound to the decision of an independent third party, and mediation, where a third party tries to arrange a settlement between the two sides. ALTERNATIVE MARKETS Nontraditional mechanisms used to finance risk. This includes captives, which are insurers owned by one or more non- insurers to provide owners with coverage. Risk-retention groups, formed by members of similar professions or businesses to ob- tain liability insurance and self-insurance, are also included. ANNUAL ANNUITY CONTRACT FEE Covers the cost of administering an annu- ity contract. ANNUAL STATEMENT Summary of an insurer\u2019s or reinsurer\u2019s financial operations for a particular year, including a balance sheet. It is filed with the state insurance department of each ju- risdiction in which the company is licensed to conduct business. ANNUITANT The person who receives the income from an annuity contract. Usually the owner of the contract or his or her spouse. ANNUITIZATION The conversion of the account balance of a deferred annuity contract to income payments. ANNUITY A life insurance product that pays periodic income benefits for a specific period of time or over the course of the annuitant\u2019s lifetime. There are two basic types of an- nuities: deferred and immediate. Deferred annuities allow assets to grow tax-deferred over time before being converted to pay- ments to the annuitant. Immediate annui-", "OperationalPageNumber": "86, 87, 88", "PageNumber": "79, 80, 81", "Header": ", Glossary", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Second Injury Funds: -> Workers Compensation -> Terrorism Coverage: -> Glossary", "Text": "ties allow payments to begin within about a year of purchase. ANNUITY ACCUMULATION PHASE OR PERIOD The period during which the owner of a deferred annuity makes payments to build up assets. ANNUITY ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGES Covers the cost of customer services for owners of variable annuities. ANNUITY BENEFICIARY In certain types of annuities, a person who receives annuity contract payments if the annuity owner or annuitant dies while pay- ments are still due. ANNUITY CERTAIN A type of annuity contract that pays peri- odic income benefits for a stated period of time, regardless of whether the annuitant lives or dies. Also known as period certain annuity. Contrast with Straight life annuity. See Payout options) ANNUITY CONTRACT An agreement similar to an insurance policy for other insurance products such as auto insurance. ANNUITY CONTRACT OWNER The person or entity that purchases an annuity and has all rights to the contract. Usually, but not always, the annuitant (the person who receives incomes from the contract). ANNUITY COST A monetary amount that is equal to the present value of future periodic income payments under an annuity. ( See Gross an- nuity cost; Income date; Net annuity cost) ANNUITY DATE See Income date. ANNUITY DEATH BENEFITS The guarantee that if an annuity contract owner dies before annuitization (the swi- tchover from the savings to the payment phase) the beneficiary will receive the value of the annuity that is due. ANNUITY INSURANCE CHARGES Covers administrative and mortality and expense risk costs. ANNUITY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE The fee paid for the management of vari- able annuity invested assets. ANNUITY ISSUER The insurance company that issues the annuity. ANNUITY PROSPECTUS Legal document providing detailed infor- mation about variable annuity contracts. Must be offered to each prospective buyer. ANNUITY PURCHASE RATE The cost of an annuity based on such fac- tors as the age and gender of the contract owner. ANTISELECTION The tendency of individuals who suspect or know they are more likely than average to experience loss to apply for or renew insur- ance to a greater extent than people who lack such knowledge of probable loss. Also known as adverse selection and selection against the company. ANTITRUST LAWS Laws that prohibit companies from work- ing as a group to set prices, restrict supplies or stop competition in the marketplace. The insurance industry is subject to state antitrust laws but has a limited exemption from federal antitrust laws. This exemption, set out in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, per- mits insurers to jointly develop common insurance forms and share loss data to help them price policies. APPORTIONMENT The dividing of a loss proportionately among two or more insurers that cover the same loss. APPRAISAL A survey to determine a property\u2019s insur- able value, or the amount of a loss. ARBITRATION Procedure in which an insurance company and the insured or a vendor agree to settle a claim dispute by accepting a decision made by a third party. ARSON The deliberate setting of a fire. ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES Bonds that represent pools of loans of similar types, duration and interest rates. Almost any loan with regular repayments of principal and interest can be securitized, from auto loans and equipment leases to credit card receivables and mortgages. ASSETS Property owned, in this case by an insur- ance company, including stocks, bonds and real estate. Insurance accounting is concerned with solvency and the ability to pay claims. State insurance laws therefore require a conservative valuation of assets, prohibiting insurance companies from listing assets on their balance sheets whose values are uncertain, such as furniture, fix- tures, debit balances and accounts receiv- able that are more than 90 days past due. See Admitted assets) ASSIGNED RISK PLANS Facilities through which drivers can obtain auto insurance if they are unable to buy it in the regular or voluntary market. These are the most well-known type of residual auto insurance market, which exist in every state. In an assigned risk plan, all insur- ers selling auto insurance in the state are assigned these drivers to insure, based on the amount of insurance they sell in the regular market. ( See Residual market) ASSIGNMENT An agreement under which one party\u2014 the assignor\u2014transfers some or all of his owner-ship rights in a particular property, such as a life insurance policy or an annuity contract, to another party\u2014 the assignee. ( See Absolute assignment; Collateral assignment) ASSOCIATION GROUP A type of group that generally is eligible for group insurance and that consists of members of an association of individuals formed for a purpose other than to obtain insurance coverage, such as teachers\u2019 asso- ciations and physicians\u2019 associations. AUTO INSURANCE POLICY There are basically six different types of coverages. Some may be required by law. Others are optional. They are: 1.  Bodily injury liability, for injuries the policyholder causes to someone else. 2.  Medical payments or Personal Injury Protection (PIP) for treatment of injuries to the driver and passengers of the policyholder\u2019s car. 3.  Property damage liability, for damage the policyholder causes to someone else\u2019s property. 4.  Collision, for damage to the policyholder\u2019s car from a collision. 5.  Comprehensive, for damage to the poli- cyholder\u2019s car not involving a collision with another car (including damage from fire, explosions, earthquakes, floods, and riots), and theft.", "OperationalPageNumber": "88, 89, 90", "PageNumber": "81, 82, 83", "Header": ", Glossary", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Second Injury Funds: -> Workers Compensation -> Terrorism Coverage: -> Glossary", "Text": "6.  Uninsured motorists coverage, for costs resulting from an accident involving a hit-and-run driver or a driver who does not have insurance. AUTO INSURANCE PREMIUM The price an insurance company charges for coverage, based on the frequency and cost of potential accidents, theft and other losses. Prices vary from company to com- pany, as with any product or service. Pre- miums also vary depending on the amount and type of coverage purchased; the make and model of the car; and the insured\u2019s driving record, years of driving and the number of miles the car is driven per year. Other factors taken into account include the driver\u2019s age and gender, where the car is most likely to be driven and the times of day\u2014rush hour in an urban neighborhood or leisure time driving in rural areas, for example. Some insurance companies may also use credit history related information. See Insurance score) AVIATION INSURANCE Commercial airlines hold property insur- ance on airplanes and liability insurance for negligent acts that result in injury or property damage to passengers or others. Damage is covered on the ground and in the air. The policy limits the geographical area and individual pilots covered. B B-SHARE VARIABLE ANNUITY A form of variable annuity contract with no initial sales charge but if the contract is cancelled the holder pays deferred sales charges (usually from 5 to 7 percent the first year, declining to zero after from 5 to 7 years). The most common form of annuity contract. BALANCE SHEET Provides a snapshot of a company\u2019s fi- nancial condition at one point in time. It shows assets, including investments and reinsurance, and liabilities, such as loss reserves to pay claims in the future, as of a certain date. It also states a company\u2019s equity, known as policyholder surplus. Changes in that surplus are one indicator of an insurer\u2019s financial standing. BANK HOLDING COMPANY A company that owns or controls one or more banks. The Federal Reserve has responsibility for regulating and supervis- ing bank holding company activities, such as approving acquisitions and mergers and inspecting the operations of such compa- nies. This authority applies even though a bank owned by a holding company may be under the primary supervision of the Comptroller of the Currency or the FDIC. BASIS POINT 0.01 percent of the yield of a mortgage, bond or note. The smallest measure used. BEACH AND WINDSTORM PLANS State-sponsored insurance pools that sell property coverage for the peril of wind- storm to people unable to buy it in the voluntary market because of their high exposure to risk. Several states offer these plans to cover residential and commercial properties against hurricanes and other windstorms. ( See Fair access to insurance requirements plans/FAIR plans; Residual market) BENEFICIARY The person or legal entity the owner of an insurance policy names to receive the policy benefit if the event insured against occurs. ( See Annuity beneficiary; Contin- gent beneficiary; Irrevocable beneficiary) BINDER Temporary authorization of coverage issued prior to the actual insurance policy. BLANKET INSURANCE Coverage for more than one type of prop- erty at one location or one type of property at more than one location. Example: chain stores. BODILY INJURY LIABILITY COVERAGE Portion of an auto insurance policy that covers injuries the policyholder causes to someone else. BOILER AND MACHINERY INSURANCE Often called Equipment Breakdown, or Sys- tems Breakdown insurance. Commercial in- surance that covers damage caused by the malfunction or breakdown of boilers, and a vast array of other equipment including air conditioners, heating, electrical, telephone and computer systems. BOND A security that obligates the issuer to pay interest at specified intervals and to repay the principal amount of the loan at maturity. In insurance, a form of surety- ship. Bonds of various types guarantee a payment or a reimbursement for financial losses resulting from dishonesty, failure to perform and other acts. BOND RATING An evaluation of a bond\u2019s financial strength, conducted by such major ratings agencies as Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s Investors Service. BOOK OF BUSINESS Total amount of insurance on an insurer\u2019s books at a particular point in time. BROKER An intermediary between a customer and an insurance company. Brokers typically search the market for coverage appropriate to their clients. They work on commission and usually sell commercial, not personal, insurance. In life insurance, agents must be licensed as securities brokers/dealers to sell variable annuities, which are similar to stock market-based investments. BURGLARY AND THEFT INSURANCE Insurance for the loss of property due to burglary, robbery or larceny. It is provided in a standard homeowners policy and in a business multiple peril policy. BUSINESS INCOME INSURANCE Commercial coverage that reimburses a business owner for lost profits and continu- ing fixed expenses during the time that a business must stay closed while the prem- ises are being restored because of physical damage from a covered peril, such as a fire. Business income insurance also may cover financial losses that may occur if civil authorities limit access to an area after a disaster and their actions prevent custom- ers from reaching the business premises. Depending on the policy, civil authorities coverage may start after a waiting period and last for two or more weeks. Also known as business interruption insurance. BUSINESSOWNERS POLICY/BOP A policy that combines property, liability and business interruption coverages for small- to medium-sized businesses. Cover- age is generally cheaper than if purchased through separate insurance policies.", "OperationalPageNumber": "90, 91, 92", "PageNumber": "83, 84, 85", "Header": ", Glossary", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Second Injury Funds: -> Workers Compensation -> Terrorism Coverage: -> Glossary", "Text": "C C-SHARE VARIABLE ANNUITIES A form of variable annuity contract where the contract holder pays no sales fee up front or surrender charges. Owners can claim full liquidity at any time. CAPACITY The supply of insurance available to meet demand. Capacity depends on the indus- try\u2019s financial ability to accept risk. For an individual insurer, the maximum amount of risk it can underwrite based on its finan- cial condition. The adequacy of an insurer\u2019s capital relative to its exposure to loss is an important measure of solvency. A property/ casualty insurer must maintain a certain level of capital and policyholder surplus to underwrite risks. This capital is known as capacity. When the industry is hit by high losses, such as after the World Trade Center terrorist attack, capacity is diminished. It can be restored by increases in net income, favorable investment returns, reinsuring more risk and or raising additional capi- tal. When there is excess capacity, usually because of a high return on investments, premiums tend to decline as insurers com- pete for market share. As premiums decline, underwriting losses are likely to grow, reducing capacity and causing insurers to raise rates and tighten conditions and limits in an effort to increase profitability. Policyholder surplus is sometimes used as a measure of capacity. CAPITAL Shareholder\u2019s equity (for publicly traded in- surance companies) and retained earnings for mutual insurance companies). There is no general measure of capital adequacy for property/casualty insurers. Capital adequacy is linked to the riskiness of an insurer\u2019s business. A company underwrit- ing medical device manufacturers needs a larger cushion of capital than a company writing Main Street business, for example. See Risk-based capital; Solvency; Surplus) CAPITAL MARKETS The markets in which equities and debt are traded. ( See Securitization of insurance risk) CAPTIVE AGENT A person who represents only one insur- ance company and is restricted by agree- ment from submitting business to any other company, unless it is first rejected by the agent\u2019s captive company. ( See Exclusive agent) CAPTIVES Insurers that are created and wholly owned by one or more non-insurers, to provide owners with coverage. A form of self-insur- ance. CAR YEAR Equal to 365 days of insured coverage for a single vehicle. It is the standard measure- ment for automobile insurance. CASE MANAGEMENT A system of coordinating medical services to treat a patient, improve care and reduce cost. A case manager coordinates health care delivery for patients. CASH DIVIDEND OPTION For participating insurance policies, a divi- dend option under which the insurer sends the policy owner a check in the amount of the policy dividend. ( See Dividend; Policy dividend options) CASH PAYMENT OPTION One of several nonforfeiture options included in life insurance policies and some annuity contracts that allows a policy owner to receive the cash surrender value of a life insurance policy or an annuity con- tract in a single payment. Also known as cash surrender option. ( See Cash surrender value; Nonforfeiture options) CASH SURRENDER VALUE 1) For life insurance, the amount, before adjustments for factors such as policy loans, that the owner of a permanent life insurance policy is entitled to receive if the policy does not remain in force until the insured\u2019s death. (2) For annuities, the amount of a deferred annuity\u2019s accumu- lated value, less any surrender charges, that the contract holder is entitled to receive if the policy is surrendered during its accu- mulation period. Also known as cash value and surrender value. CASH VALUE See Cash surrender value. CATASTROPHE Term used for statistical recording purposes to refer to a single incident or a series of closely related incidents causing severe insured property losses totaling more than a given amount, currently $25 million. CATASTROPHE BONDS Risk-based securities that pay high inter- est rates and provide insurance companies with a form of reinsurance to pay losses from a catastrophe such as those caused by a major hurricane. They allow insurance risk to be sold to institutional investors in the form of bonds, thus spreading the risk. See Securitization of insurance risk) CATASTROPHE DEDUCTIBLE A percentage or dollar amount that a homeowner must pay before the insur- ance policy kicks in when a major natural disaster occurs. These large deductibles limit an insurer\u2019s potential losses in such cases, allowing it to insure more property. A property insurer may not be able to buy reinsurance to protect its own bottom line unless it keeps its potential maximum losses under a certain level. CATASTROPHE FACTOR Probability of catastrophic loss, based on the total number of catastrophes in a state over a 40-year period. CATASTROPHE MODEL Using computers, a method to mesh long- term disaster information with current demographic, building and other data to determine the potential cost of natural disasters and other catastrophic losses for a given geographic area. CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE Reinsurance for catastrophic losses. The insurance industry is able to absorb the multibillion dollar losses caused by natural and man-made disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and terrorist attacks because losses are spread among thousands of companies including catastrophe reinsurers who operate on a global basis. Insurers\u2019 ability and willingness to sell insurance fluctuates with the availability and cost of catastrophe reinsurance. After major disasters, such as Hurricane Andrew and the World Trade Center terrorist attack, the availability of catastrophe reinsurance becomes extremely limited. Claims deplete reinsurers\u2019 capital and, as a result, companies are more selective in the type and amount of risks they assume. In addition, with available supply limited, prices for reinsurance rise. This contributes to an overall increase in prices for property insurance. CELLPHONE INSURANCE Separate insurance provided to cover cell phones for damage or theft. Policies are often sold with the cell phones themselves.", "OperationalPageNumber": "92, 93, 94", "PageNumber": "85, 86, 87", "Header": ", Glossary", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Second Injury Funds: -> Workers Compensation -> Terrorism Coverage: -> Glossary", "Text": "CHARTERED FINANCIAL CONSULTANT/ChFC A professional designation given by The American College to financial services professionals who complete courses in financial planning.

CLAIMS MADE POLICY A form of insurance that pays claims presented to the insurer during the term of the policy or within a specific term after its expiration. It limits liability insurers\u2019 exposure to unknown future liabilities. ( See Occurrence policy) COBRA Short for Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. A federal law under which group health plans sponsored by employers with 20 or more employees must offer continuation of coverage to employ- ees who leave their jobs and their depen- dents. The employee must pay the entire premium. Coverage can be extended up to 18 months. Surviving dependents can receive longer coverage. COINSURANCE In property insurance, requires the policy- holder to carry insurance equal to a speci- fied percentage of the value of property to receive full payment on a loss. For health insurance, it is a percentage of each claim above the deductible paid by the policy- holder. For a 20 percent health insurance coinsurance clause, the policyholder pays for the deductible plus 20 percent of his covered losses. After paying 80 percent of losses up to a specified ceiling, the insurer starts paying 100 percent of losses. COLLATERAL Property that is offered to secure a loan or other credit and that becomes subject to seizure on default. Also called security. COLLATERAL ASSIGNMENT A temporary transfer of some of the owner- ship rights in a particular property, such as a life insurance policy or an annuity contract, as collateral for a loan. The transfer is made on the condition that upon payment of the debt for which the contract is collateral, all transferred rights shall revert back to the original owner. Contrast with Absolute assign- ment. COLLISION COVERAGE Portion of an auto insurance policy that cov- ers the damage to the policyholder\u2019s car from a collision. COMBINED RATIO Percentage of each premium dollar a prop- erty/casualty insurer spends on claims and expenses. A decrease in the combined ratio means financial results are improving; an increase means they are deteriorating. COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE Provides coverage for vehicles that are used primarily in connection with commercial establishments or business activities. While the major coverages are the same, commer- cial auto policies differs from a personal auto policy in a number of technical respects. See Auto Insurance Policy). COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE/CGL A broad commercial policy that covers all liability exposures of a business that are not specifically excluded. Coverage includes product liability, completed operations, premises and operations, and independent contractors. COMMERCIAL LINES Products designed for and bought by busi- nesses. Among the major coverages are boiler and machinery, business income, commercial auto, comprehensive general liability, direc- tors and officers liability, fire and allied lines, inland marine, medical malpractice liability, product liability, professional liability, surety and fidelity, and workers compensation. Most of these commercial coverages can be purchased separately except business income, which must be added to a fire insurance property) policy. ( See Commercial multiple peril policy) COMMERCIAL MULTIPLE PERIL POLICY Package policy that includes property, boiler and machinery, crime and general liability coverages. COMMERCIAL PAPER Short-term, unsecured and, usually, discounted promissory note issued by commercial firms and financial companies often to finance current business. Com- mercial paper, which is rated by debt rating agencies, is sold through dealers or directly placed with an investor. COMMISSION Fee paid to an agent or insurance salesper- son as a percentage of the policy premium. The percentage varies widely depending on coverage, the insurer, and the marketing methods. COMPLETED OPERATIONS COVERAGE Pays for bodily injury or property damage caused by a completed project or job. Pro- tects a business that sells a service against liability claims. COMMUNITY RATING LAWS Enacted in several states on health insur- ance policies. Insurers are required to ac- cept all applicants for coverage and charge all applicants the same premium for the same coverage regardless of age or health. Premiums are based on the rate determined by the geographic region\u2019s health and demographic profile. COMMUTATIVE CONTRACT An agreement under which the contract- ing parties specify the values that they will exchange; moreover, the parties generally exchange items or services that they think are of relatively equal value. Contrast with Aleatory contract. COMPETITIVE REPLACEMENT PARTS See Crash parts; Generic auto parts. COMPETITIVE STATE FUND A facility established by a state to sell workers compensation in competition with private insurers. COMPLAINT RATIO A measure used by some state insurance departments to track consumer complaints against insurance companies. Generally, it is stated as the number of complaints upheld against an insurance company, as a percentage of premiums written. In some states, complaints from medical providers over the promptness of payments may also be included. COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE Portion of an auto insurance policy that covers damage to the policyholder\u2019s car not involving a collision with another car including damage from fire, explosions, earthquakes, floods and riots), and theft. COMPULSORY AUTO INSURANCE The minimum amount of auto liability insurance that meets a state law. Financial responsibility laws in every state require all automobile drivers to show proof, after an accident, of their ability to pay damages up to the state minimum. In compulsory li- ability states this proof, which is usually in the form of an insurance policy, is required before you can legally drive a car. CONTESTABLE PERIOD The time during which an insurer has the right to cancel or rescind an insurance policy if the application contained a mate- rial misrepresentation. ( See Incontestability provision) CONTINGENT BENEFICIARY The party designated to receive the pro- ceeds of a life insurance policy following the insured\u2019s death if the primary benefi- ciary predeceased the insured.

CREDIT ENHANCEMENT A technique to lower the interest payments on a bond by raising the issue\u2019s credit rat- ing, often through insurance in the form of a financial guarantee or with standby letters of credit issued by a bank. CREDIT INSURANCE Commercial coverage against losses result- ing from the failure of business debtors to pay their obligation to the insured, usually due to insolvency. The coverage is geared to manufacturers, wholesalers and service providers who may be dependent on a few accounts and therefore could lose signifi- cant income in the event of an insolvency. CREDIT LIFE INSURANCE Life insurance coverage on a borrower designed to repay the balance of a loan in the event the borrower dies before the loan is repaid. It may also include disablement and can be offered as an option in connec- tion with credit cards and auto loans. CREDIT RATING See Bond rating. CREDIT SCORE The number produced by an analysis of an individual\u2019s credit history. The use of credit information affects all consumers in many ways, including getting a job, finding a place to live, securing a loan, getting tele- phone service and buying insurance. Credit history is routinely reviewed by insurers before issuing a commercial policy because businesses in poor financial condition tend to cut back on safety, which can lead to more accidents and more claims. Auto and home insurers may use information in a credit history to produce an insurance score. Insurance scores may be used in underwriting and rating insurance policies. See Insurance score) CRIME INSURANCE Term referring to property coverages for the perils of burglary, theft and robbery. CRITICAL ILLNESS (CI) INSURANCE A type of individual health insurance that pays a lump-sum benefit when the insured is diagnosed with a specified illness. Also known as critical diagnosis insurance.

Some liability claims may be filed long after the event that caused the injury to occur. Asbestos-related diseases, for ex- ample, do not show up until decades after the exposure. IBNR also refers to estimates made about claims already reported but where the full extent of the injury is not yet known, such as a workers compensa- tion claim where the degree to which work- related injuries prevents a worker from earning what he or she earned before the injury unfolds over time.

When regulators deem an insurance company is in danger of becoming insolvent, they can take one of three actions: place a company in conservatorship or rehabilitation, if the company can be saved, or in liquidation, if salvage is deemed impossible. The differ- ence between the first two options is one of degree\u2014regulators guide companies in conservatorship but direct those in rehabili- tation. Typically the first sign of problems is inability to pass the financial tests regula- tors administer as a routine procedure. ( See Liquidation; Risk-based capital) INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR An organization such as a bank or insur- ance company that buys and sells large quantities of securities. INSURABLE INTEREST In insurance, a person exhibits an insurable interest in a potential loss if that person will suffer a genuine economic loss if the event insured against occurs. Without the presence of insurable interest, an insurance contract is not formed for a lawful purpose and, thus, is not a valid contract. INSURABLE RISK Risks for which it is relatively easy to get insurance and that meet certain criteria. These include being definable, accidental in nature, and part of a group of similar risks large enough to make losses predict- able. The insurance company also must be able to come up with a reasonable price for the insurance. INSURANCE A system to make large financial losses more affordable by pooling the risks of many individuals and business entities and transferring them to an insurance company or other large group in return for a premium. INSURANCE POOL A group of insurance companies that pools its assets, enabling them to provide an amount of insurance substantially more than can be provided by individual com- panies to ensure large risks such as nuclear power stations. Pools may be formed voluntarily or mandated by the state to insure risks that cannot be covered in the voluntary market such as coastal properties subject to hurricanes.

IRREVOCABLE BENEFICIARY A life insurance policy beneficiary who has a vested interest in the policy proceeds even during the insured\u2019s lifetime because the policy owner has the right to change the beneficiary designation only after obtain- ing the beneficiary\u2019s consent. Contrast with Revocable beneficiary. J JOINT AND SURVIVOR ANNUITY An annuity with two annuitants, usually spouses. Payments continue until the death of the longest living of the two. JOINT UNDERWRITING ASSOCIATION/JUA Insurers that join together to provide coverage for a particular type of risk or size of exposure, when there are difficulties in obtaining coverage in the regular market, and which share in the profits and losses associated with the program. JUAs may be set up to provide auto and homeowners in- JUNK BONDS Corporate bonds with credit ratings of BB or less. They pay a higher yield than invest- ment grade bonds because issuers have a higher perceived risk of default. Such bonds involve market risk that could force investors, including insurers, to sell the bonds when their value is low. Most states place limits on insurers\u2019 investments in these bonds. In general, because property/ casualty insurers can be called upon to provide huge sums of money immediately after a disaster, their investments must be liquid. Less than 2 percent are in real estate and a similarly small percent are in junk bonds. JOINT AND SURVIVOR ANNUITY An annuity with two annuitants, usually spouses. Payments continue until the death of the longest living of the two. K KEY PERSON INSURANCE Insurance on the life or health of a key in- dividual whose services are essential to the continuing success of a business and whose death or disability could cause the firm a substantial financial loss.

Originally, Lloyd\u2019s was a London coffee house in the 1600s patronized by shipowners who insured each other\u2019s hulls and cargoes. As Lloyd\u2019s developed, wealthy individuals, called \u201cNames,\u201d placed their personal assets behind insurance risks as a business venture. Increasingly since the 1990s, most of the capital comes from corporations. LLOYDS Corporation formed to market services of a group of underwriters.

RATING AGENCIES There are several major credit agencies that determine insurers\u2019 financial strength and viability to meet claims obligations. They include A.M. Best Co.; Fitch, Inc.; Moody\u2019s Investors Services; Standard & Poor\u2019s Corp.; and Weiss Ratings, Inc. Factors considered include company earnings, capital adequa- cy, operating leverage, liquidity, investment performance, reinsurance programs, and management ability, integrity and experi- ence. RATING BUREAU The insurance business is based on the spread of risk. The more widely risk is spread, the more accurately loss can be estimated. An insurance company can more accurately estimate the probability of loss on 100,000 homes than on ten. Years ago, insurers were required to use standard- ized forms and rates developed by rating agencies. Today, large insurers use their own statistical loss data to develop rates. But small insurers, or insurers focusing on special lines of business, with insufficiently broad loss data to make them actuarially re- liable depend on pooled industry data col- lected by such organizations as ISO, which provides information to help develop rates such as estimates of future losses and loss adjustment expenses like legal defense costs. REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS Investments generally owned by life insur- ers that include commercial mortgage loans and real property. RECEIVABLES Amounts owed to a business for goods or services provided.

( See Nonforfeiture options) REGISTERED PRINCIPAL An officer or manager of a National Associ- ation of Securities Dealers (NASD) member, who is involved in the day-to-day opera- tion of the securities business, has qualified as a registered representative, and has an NASD Series 24 or 26 registration. REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE A sales representative or other person who has registered with the National Associa- tion of Securities Dealers (NASD), disclosed the required background information, and passed one or more NASD examination.

REINSTATEMENT The process by which an insurer puts back into force an insurance policy that has either been terminated for nonpayment of premiums or continued as extended term or reduced paid-up coverage. REINSURANCE Insurance bought by insurers. A reinsurer assumes part of the risk and part of the premium originally taken by the insurer, known as the primary company. Reinsur- ance effectively increases an insurer\u2019s capi- tal and therefore its capacity to sell more coverage. The business is global and some of the largest reinsurers are based abroad. Reinsurers have their own reinsurers, called retrocessionaires. Reinsurers don\u2019t pay poli- cyholder claims. Instead, they reimburse insurers for claims paid.

RENEWABLE TERM INSURANCE POLICY A term life insurance policy that gives the policy owner the option to continue the coverage at the end of the specified term without presenting evidence of insurability, although typically at a higher premium based on the insured\u2019s attained age. RENTERS INSURANCE A form of insurance that covers a policy- holder\u2019s belongings against perils such as fire, theft, windstorm, hail, explosion, vandalism, riots, and others. It also provides personal liability coverage for damage the policyholder or dependents cause to third parties. It also provides additional living expenses, known as loss-of-use coverage, if a policyholder must move while his or her dwelling is repaired. It also can include coverage for property improvements. Posses- sions can be covered for their replacement cost or for their actual cash value, which includes depreciation. REPLACEMENT COST Insurance that pays the dollar amount needed to replace damaged personal property or dwelling property without deducting for depreciation but limited by the maximum dollar amount shown on the declarations page of the policy. REPURCHASE AGREEMENT/\u2018REPO\u2019 Agreement between a buyer and seller where the seller agrees to repurchase the securities at an agreed upon time and price.

Mea- sures profitability by showing how effi- ciently invested capital is being used. RESERVES A company\u2019s best estimate of what it will pay for claims. RESIDUAL DISABILITY In disability income insurance, a condition in which the insured is not totally disabled, but is still unable to function as before the sickness or injury, and therefore suffers a reduction in income of at least the percent- age\u2014typically 20 percent to 25 percent\u2014 specified in the disability income plan. Also known as partial disability. RESIDUAL DISABILITY INSURANCE See Income protection insurance. RESIDUAL MARKET Facilities, such as assigned risk plans and FAIR Plans, that exist to provide coverage for those who cannot get it in the regular market. Insurers doing business in a given state generally must participate in these pools. For this reason the residual market is also known as the shared market. RETENTION The amount of risk retained by an insur- ance company that is not reinsured. RETROCESSION The reinsurance bought by reinsurers to protect their financial stability. RETROSPECTIVE RATING A method of permitting the final premium for a risk to be adjusted, subject to an agreed upon maximum and minimum limit based on actual loss experience. It is available to large commercial insurance buyers. REVOCABLE BENEFICIARY A life insurance policy beneficiary whose right to the policy\u2019s proceeds can be can- celled or reduced by the policy owner at any time before the insured\u2019s death. Contrast with Irrevocable beneficiary. RIDER An attachment to an insurance policy that alters the policy\u2019s coverage or terms. RISK The chance of loss or the person or entity that is insured. RISK MANAGEMENT Management of the varied risks to which a business firm or association might be sub- ject. It includes analyzing all exposures to gauge the likelihood of loss and choosing options to better manage or minimize loss. These options typically include reducing and eliminating the risk with safety mea- sures, buying insurance, and self-insurance. RISK-RETENTION GROUPS Businesses that band together to self-insure and form an organization, which is char- tered and licensed as an insurer in at least one state, to handle liability insurance. RISK-BASED CAPITAL The need for insurance companies to be capitalized according to the inherent riskiness of the type of insurance they sell. Higher risk types of insurance, liability as opposed to property business, generally necessitate higher levels of capital.

Also known as direct rollover and direct transfer. S SALVAGE Damaged property an insurer takes over to reduce its loss after paying a claim. Insur- ers receive salvage rights over property on which they have paid claims, such as badly damaged cars. Insurers that paid claims on cargoes lost at sea now have the right to recover sunken treasures. Salvage charges are the costs associated with recovering that property.

( See Catastrophe bonds) SEGREGATED ACCOUNT In Canada, an investment account that insurers maintain separately from a general account to help manage the funds placed in variable insurance products such as vari- able annuities. ( See Separate account) SELF-INSURANCE The concept of assuming a financial risk oneself, instead of paying an insurance company to take it on. Every policyholder is a self-insurer in terms of paying a deduct- ible and co-payments. Large firms often self-insure frequent, small losses such as damage to their fleet of vehicles or minor workplace injuries. However, to protect injured employees state laws set out re- quirements for the assumption of workers compensation programs. Self-insurance also refers to employers who assume all or part of the responsibility for paying the health insurance claims of their employees. Firms that self insure for health claims are exempt from state insurance laws mandat- ing the illnesses that group health insurers must cover. SEPARATE ACCOUNT In the United States, an investment ac- count maintained separately from an in- surer\u2019s general account to help manage the funds placed in variable insurance products such as variable annuities. Contrast with General account. ( See Segregated account) SETTLEMENT OPTIONS Choices given to the owner or beneficiary of a life insurance policy regarding the method by which the insurer will pay the policy\u2019s proceeds when the policy owner does not receive the benefits in one single payment. Typically, the owner can elect (1) to leave the proceeds with the insurer and earn a specified interest rate, (2) to have the proceeds paid in a series of installments for a pre-selected period, (3) to have the proceeds paid in a pre-selected sum in a series of installments for as long as the proceeds last, or (4) to have the insurer tie payment of the proceeds to the life expec- tancy of a named individual through a life annuity. Also known as optional modes of settlement. ( See Life annuity) SEVERITY Size of a loss. One of the criteria used in calculating premiums rates. SEWER BACKUP COVERAGE An optional part of homeowners insurance that covers sewers. SHARED MARKET See Residual market.

SPLIT-DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE PLAN An agreement under which a business pro- vides individual life insurance policies for certain employees, who share in paying the cost of the policies. SPREAD OF RISK The selling of insurance in multiple areas to multiple policyholders to minimize the danger that all policyholders will have losses at the same time. Companies are more likely to insure perils that offer a good spread of risk. Flood insurance is an example of a poor spread of risk because the people most likely to buy it are the people close to rivers and other bodies of water that flood. ( See Adverse selection) STACKING Practice that increases the money avail- able to pay auto liability claims. In states where this practice is permitted by law, courts may allow policyholders who have several cars insured under a single policy, or multiple vehicles insured under differ- ent policies, to add up the limit of liability available for each vehicle. STANDARD RISK CLASS In insurance underwriting, the group of proposed insureds who represent average risk within the context of the insurer\u2019s", "OperationalPageNumber": "126, 127, 128", "PageNumber": "119, 120, 121", "Header": ", Glossary", "Footer": "I.I.I.InsuranceHandbookwww.iii.org/insurancehandbook"}, {"FileName": "Insurance_Handbook", "Title": "Second Injury Funds: -> Workers Compensation -> Terrorism Coverage: -> Glossary", "Text": "underwriting practices and therefore pay average premiums in relation to others of similar insurability. Contrast with Declined risk class, Preferred risk class and Substan- dard risk class. STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES/SAP More conservative standards than under GAAP accounting rules, they are imposed by state laws that emphasize the present solvency of insurance companies. SAP helps ensure that the company will have sufficient funds readily available to meet all antici- pated insurance obligations by recognizing liabilities earlier or at a higher value than GAAP and assets later or at a lower value. For example, SAP requires that selling expenses be recorded immediately rather than amor- tized over the life of the policy. ( See Admitted assets; GAAP accounting) STOCK INSURANCE COMPANY An insurance company owned by its stockholders who share in profits through earnings distributions and increases in stock value. STRAIGHT LIFE ANNUITY A type of life annuity contract that pro- vides periodic income payments for as long as the annuitant lives but provides no ben- efit payments after the annuitant\u2019s death. See Life annuity) STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT Legal agreement to pay a designated person, usually someone who has been injured, a specified sum of money in periodic payments, usually for his or her lifetime, instead of in a single lump sum payment. See Annuity) SUBROGATION The legal process by which an insurance company, after paying a loss, seeks to re- cover the amount of the loss from another party who is legally liable for it. SUBSTANDARD PREMIUM RATES The premium rates charged insureds who are classified as substandard risks. Also known as special class rates. SUBSTANDARD RISK CLASS In insurance underwriting, the group of proposed insureds who represent a signifi- cantly greater-than-average likelihood of loss within the context of the insurer\u2019s un- derwriting practices. Also known as special class risk. Contrast with Declined risk class, Preferred risk class and Standard risk class. SUICIDE EXCLUSION PROVISION A life insurance policy provision stating that policy proceeds will not be paid if the insured dies as the result of suicide as defined within the policy within a specified period following the date of policy issue. SUPERFUND A federal law enacted in 1980 to initiate cleanup of the nation\u2019s abandoned hazard- ous waste dump sites and to respond to accidents that release hazardous substances into the environment.

SURPLUS The remainder after an insurer\u2019s liabilities are subtracted from its assets. The financial cushion that protects policyholders in case of unexpectedly high claims. ( See Capital; Risk-based capital) SURPLUS LINES Property/casualty insurance coverage that isn\u2019t available from insurers licensed in the state, called admitted companies, and must be purchased from a nonadmitted car- rier. Examples include risks of an unusual nature that require greater flexibility in policy terms and conditions than exist in standard forms or where the highest rates allowed by state regulators are considered inadequate by admitted companies. Laws governing surplus lines vary by state. SURRENDER CHARGE A charge for withdrawals from an annu- ity contract before a designated surrender charge period, usually from five to seven years. SURRENDER COST COMPARISON INDEX A cost comparison index, used to com- pare insurance policies, which takes into account the time value of money and measures the cost of a policy over a 10- or 20-year period assuming the policy owner surrenders the policy for its cash value at the end of the period. Contrast with Net payment cost comparison index. SURVIVORSHIP LIFE INSURANCE A form of insurance that covers more than one person and pays a benefit after all of the insureds die. It can be used to help pay estate taxes after the deaths of a husband and wife or as a form of business continu- ation insurance. Also known as second-to- die life insurance.

The chance of an accident or theft is much higher in an urban area than in a rural one, for example. TERRORISM INSURANCE Included as a part of the package in stan- dard commercial insurance policies before September 11 virtually free of charge. Ter- rorism coverage is now generally offered separately at a price that more adequately reflects the risk.

Modern insurance has its roots in this law which concerned coverage for merchandise and ships. 1666 Great Fire of London demonstrated destructive power of fire in an urban environment, leading entrepreneur Nicholas Barbon to form a business to repair houses damaged by fire. 1684 Participants in the Friendly Society in England formed a mutual insurance company to cover fire losses. 1688 Edward Lloyd\u2019s coffee house, the precursor of Lloyd\u2019s of London, became the central meeting place for ship owners seeking insurance for a voyage. 1696 Hand in Hand Mutual Fire Company was formed. Aviva, the world\u2019s oldest continuously operating insurance company, traces its origins to this company. 1710 Charles Povey formed the Sun, the oldest insurance company in existence which still conducts business in its own name. It is the forerunner of the Royal & Sun Alliance Group. 1735 The Friendly Society, the first insurance company in the United States, was established in Charleston, South Carolina. This mutual insurance company went out of business in 1740. 1752 The Philadelphia Contributionship for the Insurance of Houses from Loss by Fire, the oldest insurance carrier in continuous operation in the United States, was established. 1759 Presbyterian Ministers Fund, the first life insurance company in the United States, was founded. 1762 Equitable Life Assurance Society, the world\u2019s oldest mutual life insurer, was formed in England. 1776 Charleston Insurance Company and the South Carolina Insurance Company, the first two United States marine insurance companies, were formed in South Carolina. 1779 Lloyd\u2019s of London introduced the first uniform ocean marine policy. 1792 Insurance Company of North America, the first stock insurance company in the United States, was established. 1813 Eagle Fire Insurance Company of New York assumed all outstanding risks of the Union Insurance Company, in the first recorded fire reinsurance agreement in the United States. 1849 New York passed the first general insurance law in the United States. 1850 Franklin Health Assurance Company of Massachusetts offered the first accident and health insurance. 1851 New Hampshire created the first formal agency to regulate insurance in the United States.

Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company, the first boiler insurance company, was established in Hartford, Connecticut. 1873 The Massachusetts Legislature adopted the first standard fire insurance policy. 1878 Fidelity and Casualty Company of New York began providing fidelity and surety bonds. 1885 Liability protection was first offered with the introduction of employers liability policies. 1890 First policies providing benefits for disabilities from specific diseases were offered. 1894 National Board of Fire Underwriters established Underwriters\u2019 Laboratories to investigate and test electrical materials to ensure they meet fire safety standards. 1898 Travelers Insurance Company issued the first automobile insurance policy in the United States. 1899 First pedestrian killed by an automobile, in New York City. 1910 New York passed the first United States workers compensation law. It was later found to be unconstitutional. 1911   Wisconsin enacted the first permanent workers compensation law in the United States. 1912 Lloyd\u2019s of London introduced aviation insurance coverage. 1925   Massachusetts passed the first compulsory automobile insurance legislation. Connecticut passed the first financial responsibility law for motorists. 1938 Federal Crop Insurance Act created the first federal crop insurance program. 1945   McCarran-Ferguson Act (Public Law 15) was enacted. It provided the insurance industry with a limited exemption to federal antitrust law, assuring the pre-eminence of state regulation of the industry. 1947 New York established the Motor Vehicle Liability Security Fund to cover auto insurance company insolvencies. This organization was a precursor of the state guaranty funds established by insurers in all states to absorb the claims of insolvent insurers. 1950 First package insurance policies for homeowners coverage were introduced. 1960 Boston Plan was established to address insurance availability problems in urban areas in Boston. 1968 First state-run Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plans were set up to ensure property insurance availability in high-risk areas. The federal flood insurance program was established with the passage of the National Flood Insurance Act. It enabled property owners in communities that participate in flood reduction programs to purchase insurance against flood losses. 1971   Massachusetts became the first state to establish a true no-fault automobile insurance plan. 1981 Federal Risk Retention Act of 1981 was enacted. The law fostered the growth of risk retention groups and other nontraditional insurance mechanisms. The Illinois Legislature created the Illinois Insurance Exchange, a cooperative effort of individual brokers and risk bearers operating as a single market, similar to Lloyd\u2019s of London. 1985   Mission Insurance Group failed.
