Term Life Term insurance is the simplest form of life insurance. It pays only if death occurs during the term of the policy, which is usually from one to 30 years. Most term policies have no other benefit provisions. There are two basic types of term life insurance policies: level term and decreasing term. Level term means that the death benefit stays the same throughout the duration of the policy. Decreasing term means that the death benefit drops, usually in one-year incre- ments, over the course of the policy\u2019s term. Term insurance is the simplest form of life insurance.

Whole Life/Permanent Life Whole life or permanent insurance pays a death benefit whenever the policy- holder dies. There are three major types of whole life or permanent life insur- ance\u2014traditional whole life, universal life, and variable universal life, and there are variations within each type. In the case of traditional whole life, both the death benefit and the premi- um are designed to stay the same (level) throughout the life of the policy. The cost per $1,000 of benefit increases as the insured person ages, and it obviously gets very high when the insured lives to 80 and beyond. The insurance com- pany keeps the premium level by charging a premium that, in the early years, is higher than what is needed to pay claims, investing that money, and then using it to supplement the level premium to help pay the cost of life insurance for older people. By law, when these \u201coverpayments\u201d reach a certain amount, they must be available to the policyholder as a cash value if he or she decides not to continue with the original plan. The cash value is an alternative, not an additional, ben- efit under the policy. In the 1970s and 1980s, life insurance companies intro- duced two variations on the traditional whole life product: universal life insur- ance and variable universal life insurance.

In the case of traditional whole life, both the death benefit and the premi- um are designed to stay the same (level) throughout the life of the policy. The cost per $1,000 of benefit increases as the insured person ages, and it obviously gets very high when the insured lives to 80 and beyond. The insurance com- pany keeps the premium level by charging a premium that, in the early years, is higher than what is needed to pay claims, investing that money, and then using it to supplement the level premium to help pay the cost of life insurance for older people. By law, when these \u201coverpayments\u201d reach a certain amount, they must be available to the policyholder as a cash value if he or she decides not to continue with the original plan. The cash value is an alternative, not an additional, ben- efit under the policy. In the 1970s and 1980s, life insurance companies intro- duced two variations on the traditional whole life product: universal life insur- ance and variable universal life insurance. Some varieties of whole life/permanent life insurance are discussed below. UniversalLife: UniversalLife: UniversalLife: UniversalLife: UniversalLife: UniversalLife: UniversalLife: UniversalLife: Universal life, also known as adjustable life, allows more flexibility than traditional whole life policies. The savings vehicle (called a cash value account) generally earns a money market rate of interest. After money has accumulated in the account, the policyholder will also have the option of altering premium payments\u2014providing there is enough money in the account to cover the costs.

VariableLife: VariableLife: VariableLife: VariableLife: Variable life policies combine death protection with a savings account that can be invested in stocks, bonds and money market mutual funds. The value of the policy may grow more quickly, but involves more risk. If investments do not perform well, the cash value and death benefit may decrease. Some policies, however, guarantee that the death benefit will not fall below a minimum level.

Benefits to Heirs There is a common apprehension that if an individual starts an immediate lifetime annuity and dies soon after that, the insurance company keeps all of the investment in the annuity. To prevent this situation individuals can buy a guaranteed period\u201d with the immediate annuity. A guaranteed period commits the insurance company to continue payments after the owner dies to one or more designated beneficiaries; the payments continue to the end of the stated guaranteed period\u2014usually 10 or 20 years (measured from when the owner started receiving the annuity payments).

In December 2008 the Securities and Exchange Commission voted to reclassify indexed annuities (with some exceptions) as securities, not insurance products. Annuities can also be classified by marketing channel, in other words whether they are sold to groups or individuals. Annuities can be deferred or immediate. Deferred annuities generally accu- mulate assets over a long period of time, with withdrawals usually as a single sum or as an income payment beginning at retirement.

This is a period that begins when an individual first needs long-term care and lasts as long as the policy provides. During the waiting period, the policy will not pay benefits. The policy pays only for expenses that occur after the waiting period is over, if the policyholder continues to need care. In general, the longer the waiting period, the lower the premium for the long-term care policy. Benefit periods for long-term care may range from two years to a lifetime. Premiums can be kept down by electing coverage for three to four years\u2014longer than the average nursing home stay\u2014instead of a lifetime. Most long-term care policies pay on a reimbursement (or expense-incurred) basis, up to the policy limits. In other words, if the policy has a $150 per day benefit, but the policyholder spends only $130 per day for a home long-term care provider, the policy will pay only $130.
